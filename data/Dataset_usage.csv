"Cho, Hyunghoon ",YALE UNIVERSITY,"Integrative analysis of genetic determinants of health across phenotypes, ancestry groups, and research sites","Jan18, 2024",approved,"This project addresses the following question: how do we better understand the genetic basis of health and disease, considering similarities between related diseases, different types of data, complex patterns of genetic variation, across a diverse range of individuals with different genetic and sociodemographic backgrounds? We develop statistical methods to identify disease-related patterns in genomic data that can help us understand shared biological mechanisms underlying related diseases. In addition, we develop methods that can combine insights from different data sources (e.g., biobanks or health systems) without any merging of data and while ensuring the privacy of the datasets to comply with relevant data sharing policies. These tools can help us derive insights from a larger pool of individuals, which is especially helpful for studies of rare diseases or underrepresented populations. We expect this project to result in an improved understanding of genetic factors underlying human health that can improve health-related decision making in diverse populations.","The growing collection of genomic datasets are empowering researchers to discover new links between genotypes and a diverse range of health conditions. Although biobanking efforts such as the UK Biobank, the All of Us Research Program, and the Million Veterans Program have resulted in large-scale repositories including a variety of biomedical and social information about the study participants, we currently lack the analysis methods and tools needed to effectively tease apart complex genetic associations in diverse human populations, including those with rare health conditions and those from underrepresented or admixed ancestry backgrounds. To this end, we aim to develop novel statistical methods and algorithmic tools to identify disease-related patterns or biomarkers in genomic datasets to improve our understanding of shared biological mechanisms underlying different diseases. The overarching goal of this research is to overcome the challenges introduced by limited sample sizes in genetic studies by making more effective use of the available information and combining information across different contexts. As part of this work, we will develop tools that can integrate insights from different diseases, ancestry groups, data modalities, and research sites or organizations (e.g., biobanks or health systems). We aim to combine signals across different entities without any merging of data through the use of modern privacy-enhancing technologies, which ensure the privacy of the datasets to comply with relevant data sharing policies. The insights resulting from this work will enable more accurate and efficient approaches to support clinical decisions regarding diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment choices in a manner that is tailored to individual patients factoring in their genetic and social backgrounds. To support this research endeavor, we have identified and included in this application a diverse set of genomic studies in dbGaP that span different diseases and race/ethnicities represented by the study participants. We will be analyzing these datasets specifically in the contexts of association tests, fine-mapping, disease risk prediction, patient stratification, and related analyses to derive novel biomedical insights into the diseases associated with the individual datasets. Another aspect of the project aims to better understand ethical use of data with respect to privacy and equity in order to encourage collaborative research and broader data sharing. Building upon these insights, we will investigate how shared patterns of biological data across different cohorts and studies can be leveraged to improve the discovery of valuable biomedical insights.   In compliance with the PUB consent code, we will publish and otherwise broadly share any findings, computational techniques, and software tools developed in this project with the scientific community.",phs002945.v1.p1,Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics - Radical (RADx-rad): A Data Science    Approach to Identify and Manage Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in    Children (MIS-C) Associated with SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Kawasaki    Disease in Pediatric Patients

"Quandelacy, Talia ",UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,"Hyperferritinemia, COVID-19 Prediction, and Prognosis in dialysis patients","Jan18, 2024",approved,"Our research hopes to study if ferritin, a marker of inflammation and infection, can be used as a predictor for Hispanic and American Indian/Alaska Native dialysis patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. By finding new predictors of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we hope to use these early infection indicators as a way to identify sick patients earlier and prevent them from infecting others within the same dialysis center through prevention measures, such as masking, and use of COVID-19 specific rooms. The overall goal is to reduce spread of SARS-CoV-2 in dialysis centers, given that many patients who attend these centers are at high risk of severe COVID.  ","Objectives of proposed research:  Our long-term goal is to understand the role of ferritin in the natural history of disease of COVID-19 and identify clinically meaningful cut-points of elevated ferritin that may indicate SARS-CoV-2 infection among dialysis patients. As part of the objectives of the NIH funded AIM-AHEAD hub-specific pilot project award (1OT2OD032581-02-300), the objectives of this current study are to gain experience in machine learning by utilizing RADx data deposited from a multicenter study (GRANT # R01DK130067) to identify meaningful cut-points of ferritin indicative of early COVID-19 infection; develop and validate machine-learning models for early detection, hospitalizations and mortality; and determine the dynamic association of ferritin with other biomarkers and how they are related to COVID-19 severe outcomes and mortality.  Our aims are:  Specific aim 1: Explore longitudinal patterns of ferritin before and after COVID-19 confirmation and their associations with mortality and hospitalization. We will further study how patterns and associations depend on vaccination status. Specific aim 2: Study the dynamic association of ferritin with other routinely collected biomarkers, such as hemoglobin, albumin, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and how they jointly are related COVID-19 severe outcomes and mortality. Specific aim 3: Develop and validate machine-learning models for early detection of COVID-19 infection and predictions of mortality and hospitalization, and long-term complications. Study design: Longitudinal Analysis plan: Analyses for aim 1: We will fit spline models to explore population trajectories grouped by vaccination status, hospitalization, and mortality. We will apply joint modeling of longitudinal and event data methods to study the associations between ferritin and positive COVID-19 test, mortality, and hospitalization.  Analyses for aim 2: We will fit mixed effects state space models (MESSM) to study dynamic interactions between ferritin and other biomarkers.  The states of our model consist of fixed and subject-specific random effects of ferritin and other biomarkers. We will model trajectories of biomarkers using the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes or splines. We will model the dependence of COVID-19 severe outcomes and mortality on biomarker states using GLMs.  Analysis for aim 3: Treating COVID-19 through RT-PCR test as a binary outcome and using all features from multimodal data and important predictors in Aim 1 and Aim 2, we will build and compare machine learning models including random forest, logistic regression, generalized additive model, support vector machines, XGBoost, convolutional neural network (CNN), and recurrent neural network. XGBoost handles missing values naturally by learned during training. For RNN and CNN, we will associate each numerical feature with a âpresenceâ feature to deal with missing values.  Brief description of planned collaboration with researchers of other institutions, including the name of the collaborator(s) and their institution(s): We will collaborate with Yuedong Wang, PhD (University of California-Santa Barbrara) and Peter Kotanko, MD (Renal Research Institute), the MPIs of the parent grant (R01DK130067) that generated this RADx data to carry out the proposed aims.  We will also collaborate with Talia Quandelacy, PhD at the University of Colorado, Anschutz Medical Campus.  Dr. Wang will carry out the analysis on the original full data set from the parent grant, while Drs. Quandelacy and Conway will replicate the analyses in the RADx data in order to 1) validate the fidelity of RADx data to the larger source data that generated it and 2) gain experience in machine learning as part of the objectives of the NIH funded AIM-AHEAD hub-specific pilot project that focuses on a subpopulation (American Indian/Alaska Native and Hispanic dialysis patients) investigated in the above study aims.
