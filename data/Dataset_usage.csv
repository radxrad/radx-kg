"Anwar, Mohd Mozharul",NIH,Exploration of Wearable Device Data for COVID-19 ,"Mar27, 2023",approved,"Wearable devices collect various physiological signals and measurements such as heart-beat rate, respiration rate, sleep, and body movement. This study explores wearable device data for detection, risk measurement, or prediction of disease like COVID-19.","The objective of the proposed research is to explore how wearable device data from different sources can be aggregated and analyzed to draw meaningful scientific insights, such as detection, risk stratification, or prediction of disease. The datasets will be utilized to build various machine learning/deep learning models. In the process, the datasets will be standardized, normalized, and harmonized. Furthermore, it will be studied how to leverage survey data in interpreting wearable device data. The different models will be compared on the basis of various performance metrics.",phs002523.v1.p1,Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics - Radical (RADx-rad): Multi-Modal    Wireless COVID Monitoring and Infection Alerts for Concentrated    Populations
