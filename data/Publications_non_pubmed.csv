,IMI-CDE: an interactive interface for collaborative mapping of study variables to common data elements,,"Tao S,Chou WC,Li J,Du J,Ram PM,Abeysinghe R,Xu H,Jiang J,Rose PW,Ohno-Machado L,Zhang G",doi:10.1109/ICHI54592.2022.00070,"COVID-19,Common Data Element,CDE,Mapping,Data Dictionary,Study Variable,CDE Recommendation",,,"The National Institute of Health (NIH) launches the RADx Radical research collaboratives (RADx-rad) to advance new, non-traditional approaches for COVID-19 testing. RADx-rad projects are required to adopt common data elements (CDEs) to collect data to increase data interoperability. To overcome the challenges in finding appropriate CDEs for a wide range of study variables, we create a web application - IMI-CDE to ease the burden of mapping study variables to CDEs from researchers. IMI-CDE can automatically recommend CDE candidates for a study variable based on its name and description. Together with interactive mapping interfaces, IMI-CDE allows researchers to perform variable-CDE mapping with one mouse click. In addition, the IMI-CDE application supports users with multiple roles to work collaboratively on the mapping tasks. We have piloted the IMI-CDE with RADx-rad projects. 22 researchers from 8 different projects have started to use the IMI-CDE system for variable-CDE mappings. The beta-testing evaluators reported the system is intuitive, effective, and easy to use.",LM013755,2022 IEEE 10th International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (ICHI),2022
,Antibody-Free Rapid Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Proteins Using Corona Phase Molecular Recognition to Accelerate Development Time,,"Cho S-Y,Jin X,Gong X,Yang S,Cui J,Strano MS",doi:10.1021/acs.analchem.1c02889,"Fluorescence,Nanodevices,Peptides and proteins,SARS-CoV-2,Sensors",,,"To develop better analytical approaches for future global pandemics, it is widely recognized that sensing materials are necessary that enable molecular recognition and sensor assay development on a much faster scale than currently possible. Previously developed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) point-of-care devices are based on the specific molecular recognition using subunit protein antibodies and protein receptors that selectively capture the viral proteins. However, these necessarily involve complex and lengthy development and processing times and are notoriously prone to a loss of biological activity upon sensor immobilization and device interfacing, potentially limiting their use in applications at scale. Here, we report a synthetic strategy for nanoparticle corona interfaces that enables the molecular recognition of SARS-CoV-2 proteins without any antibody and receptor design. Our nanosensor constructs consist of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)─phospholipid heteropolymers adsorbed onto near-infrared (nIR) fluorescent single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) that recognize the nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 using unique three-dimensional (3D) nanosensor interfaces. This results in rapid and label-free nIR fluorescence detection. This antibody-free nanosensor shows up to 50% sensor responses within 5 min of viral protein injections with limit of detection (LOD) values of 48 fM and 350 pM for N and S proteins, respectively. Finally, we demonstrate instrumentation based on a fiber-optic platform that interfaces the advantages of antibody-free molecular recognition and biofluid compatibility in human saliva conditions.",DE030829,Anal.

,"Understanding Oligonucleotide Hybridization and the Role of Anchoring on the 
Single-Walled Carbon Nanotube Corona Phase for Viral Sensing 
Applications",,"Cui J,Gong X,Cho S-Y,Jin X,Yang S,Khosravi-Far R,Strano MS",doi:10.1021/acs.jpcc.2c06434,"Carbon nanotubes,Genetics,Hybridization,Quantum mechanics,Sensors",,,"Semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with tailored corona phases (CPs), or surface-adsorbed molecules, have emerged as a promising interface for sensing applications. The adsorption of an analyte can be specifically transduced as a modulation of their band-gap near-infrared (nIR) photoluminescence (PL). One such CP ideal for this purpose is single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), where subsequent sequence-dependent hybridization can result in PL emission wavelength shifts. Due to ssDNA adsorption to the SWCNT surface, the resultant noncanonical hybridization and its effect on SWCNT photophysical properties are not well understood. In this work, we study 20- and 21-mer DNA and RNA hybridization on the complementary ssDNA-SWCNT CP in the context of nucleic acid sensing for SARS-CoV-2 sequences as model analytes. We found that the van’t Hoff transition enthalpy of hybridization on SWCNT CP was −11.9 kJ mol–1, much lower than that of hybridization in solution (−707 kJ mol–1). We used SWCNT solvatochromism to calculate the solvent-exposed surface area to indicate successful hybridization. We found that having a 30-mer anchor region in addition to the complementary region significantly improved PL response sensitivity and selectivity, with a (GT)15 anchor preferred for RNA targets. Coincubation of ssDNA-SWCNTs with an analyte at 37 °C resulted in faster hybridization kinetics without sacrificing specificity. Other methods aimed to improve CP rearrangement kinetics such as bath sonication and surfactant additions were ineffective. We also determined that the target sequence choice is important as secondary structure formation in the target is negatively correlated with hybridization. Best-performing CPs showed detection limits of 11 and 13 nM for DNA and RNA targets, respectively. Finally, we simulated sensing conditions using the saliva environment, showing sensor compatibility in biofluids. In total, this work elucidates key design features and processing to enable sequence-specific hybridization on ssDNA-SWCNT CPs.",DE030829,J. Phys. Chem. C,2023
