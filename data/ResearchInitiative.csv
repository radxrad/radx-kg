RADx-rad,RADx-rad,RADx-rad Discoveries and Data Coordinating Center (DCC),"RADx-rad will support new, non-traditional approaches, including rapid detection devices and home-based testing technologies, that address current gaps in COVID-19 testing. The program will also support new or non-traditional applications of existing approaches to make them more usable, accessible, or accurate. These may lead to new ways to identify the current SARS-CoV-2 virus as well as potential future viruses.",https://www.nih.gov/research-training/medical-research-initiatives/radx/radx-programs#radx-rad,https://radxrad.org/,https://radxlab.org|https://github.com/radxrad
