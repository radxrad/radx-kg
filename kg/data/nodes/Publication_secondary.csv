doi:10.21203/RS.3.RS-721043/V1,SARS-CoV-2 gained the unique spike protein S1-N-Terminal Domain from the promising pangolins mixing vessel: A novel clue for the pandemic outbreak,"
 The clue behind the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 remains a huge debate among the virologist, policymakers, and general public, while the gain-of-function hypothesizes mostly focused on the furin cleavage site and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein. Here, we report that the SARS-CoV-2 gained the novel human-specific spike protein S1-N-Terminal Domain (S1-NTD) (Type-I) which is present only in SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2-rB-CoV showed unique bat-specific Type-II and Type-III-S1-NTD, which is not present in other SARS coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 variants. We also found widespread recombination and selection pressure in the S1-NTDs of the bat viruses. In addition, the Pangolin/GX/2018 and Pangolin/Guangdong/2019 lineages showed close identity (73-79%) with the Type-I-S1-NTD and Type-II-S1-NTD respectively. This justifies that the pangolin is the mixing vessel (intermediate host) to exchange the bat-specific Type-II-S1-NTD in the SARS-CoV-2-rB-CoV into Type-I-like-S1-NTD in pangolin through recombination. Furthermore, the pangolin virus with Type-I-like-S1-NTD jumped into humans which then transformed into SARS-CoV-2 with Type-I-S1-NTD by host selection pressure. Remarkably, we characterized the bat/Cambodia virus as a recombinant SARS-CoV-2/RatG13 with the S1-NTD of bat-SARS-like viruses; while only bat/RatG13 with Type-I-S1-NTD established a huge pandemic outbreak. Additionally, recent SARS-CoV-2 S1-NTD specific neutralizing antibody-based studies support the role of S1-NTD in the post-attachment of the virus; fusion, virus dissemination, and cell-cell fusion thereby prevent the onset of infection; and most of the SARS-CoV-2 variants with increased transmissibility were linked to the S1-NTD mutations. Collectively, our results strongly suggest that the gain of Type-I-S1-NTD in the SARS-CoV-2 is the reason for the pandemic outbreak.",,2021,secondary,doi:10.21203/RS.3.RS-721043/V1,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.21203/RS.3.RS-721043/V1,
doi:10.15562/ism.v14i1.1632,Penegakkan diagnosis lupus eritematosus sistemik (LES) pada anak dan multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) di rumah sakit sekunder : sebuah laporan kasus,"Background: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease that can attack various organ systems with varying severity, ranging from mild to life-threatening. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) is a hyper-inflammatory state characterized by multiorgan dysfunction caused by secondary inflammation to previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. SLE and MIS-C have similar symptoms because both diseases attack various organ systems. This paper aims to provide an overview of pediatric patients who are enforced with two diagnoses, namely SLE and MIS-C.
Case presentation: A 10-year-old female patient came to the emergency room at Sanjiwani Regional General Hospital, Gianyar, with the chief complaint of fever for four days before entering the hospital. Complaints accompanied by swollen eyelids, cough, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and lymphadenopathy. Clinical manifestations were found in various organ systems based on anamnesis, physical examinations, and laboratory examinations. The patient was diagnosed with SLE based on the EULAR/ACR 2019 criteria (obtained a score of 13) and MIS-C based on the MIS-C case definition criteria according to WHO.
Conclusion: The diagnosis of SLE is established based on EULAR/ACR 2019 criteria (obtained a score of 13), and the diagnosis of MIS-C is selected based on the MIS-C case definition criteria according to WHO.
 
Latar belakang: Lupus eritematosus sistemik (LES) adalah penyakit autoimun kronis yang mampu menyerang berbagai sistem organ dengan tingkat keparahan penyakit yang beragam, mulai dari ringan hingga mengancam nyawa. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) adalah suatu keadaan hiperinflamasi yang ditandai dengan disfungsi multiorgan yang disebabkan oleh peradangan sekunder akibat infeksi SARS-CoV-2 sebelumnya. LES dan MIS-C memiliki kemiripan gejala karena sama-sama menyerang berbagai sistem organ.

doi:10.1111/jpc.15715,Acute Renal Failure Requiring Renal Replacement Therapy: Unusual Presentation of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children,"An 18-month-boy presented with fever for 7 days, facial puffiness, periorbital oedema and anuria. He had fever and cough briefly 3 weeks earlier. All family members had a similar illness at that time. Examination showed anasarca, pitting oedema and irritability. Investigations revealed haemoglobin 85 g/L, total leukocyte count 15.5 10/L (polymorphs 44%, lymphocytes 46%, monocytes 6% and eosinophils 3%) and platelet count 707 10/L with normal peripheral smear. Biochemical investigation showed serum sodium 129 mmol/L, potassium 6.6 mmol/ L, blood urea 34.3 mmol/L and serum creatinine 999.9 μmol/L. Blood gas analysis showed pH 7.30, bicarbonate 11.2 mmol/L and serum lactate 1.1 mmol/L (normal: 0.5–1 mmol/L). His total urine output over the last 24 h was only 5 mL. As per Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) classification, he was classified as having acute kidney injury (AKI) stage III. His serum C-reactive protein was 54.6 mg/L, D-dimer 3.8 μg/mL (normal: 0.1–0.5), serum fibrinogen 275.5 mg/dL (normal: 240– 355) and serum interleukin-6 level 17.9 pg/mL (normal < 4.4). Aspartate transaminases and alanine transaminase were 32.9 U/L (<40 U/L) and 22.0 U/L (<40 U/L), respectively. Lactate dehydrogenase, serum ferritin, serum triglycerides, troponin and plasma B-type natriuretic peptide were 291.5 U/L (normal < 248), 403.9 ng/mL, 250.2 mg/dL (<150 mg/dL), negative and 11 pg/ mL (<29.40 pg/mL), respectively. He was initiated on supportive therapy and peritoneal dialysis (PD) using percutaneously inserted peel-away sheath catheter by Seldinger technique. Urine examination showed proteinuria (+2), no casts or dysmorphic red blood cells. Spot urine protein/creatinine ratio was 1.4 (normal < 0.2). Blood and urine cultures were sterile. Human immunodeficiency virus enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was non-reactive. Ultrasound of kidney, ureter and bladder (KUB) revealed normal sized kidneys with mildly increased echogenicity bilaterally. Doppler evaluation of the renal vessels was normal. Complement C3, C4, antinuclear antibodies, anticytoplasmic antibodies, serum albumin and cholesterol were normal. In view of his fever, high inflammatory markers, thrombocytosis and the family’s febrile respiratory illness 3 weeks prior, the clinical possibility of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) was considered. At the time of presentation of this case to hospital, the country was facing the second pandemic wave of COVID-19. The patient fulfilled the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health definition of paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome temporally associated with COVID-19. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction was negative, while SARS-CoV-2 antibody titres (IgG: 12.56 index; normal < 1 index) were elevated, confirming a diagnosis of MIS-C. The patient was initiated on oral prednisolone (2 mg/kg/day) and subcutaneous low-molecular weight heparin (1 mg/kg/ day). Gradually, his urine output improved to 1.3 mL/kg/h, and blood urea (5.95 mmol/L) and serum creatinine (61.88 μmol/L) normalised. PD was stopped on day 7 when his kidney function tests, electrolytes and urine examination were normal. The patient was discharged on tapering doses of oral prednisolone (over 6 weeks). MIS-C is a post-infectious phenomenon usually appearing weeks after COVID-19 infection. It is difficult to differentiate recent SARS-CoV-2 infection from an infection several months prior based on just IgG positivity. Studies have shown that antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 may persist for several months after infection but IgG titres decrease significantly during the first 6 months after exposure. Anderson et al. have shown that children with MIS-C have higher levels of IgG antibodies that neutralise SARS-CoV-2 more effectively compared to children with severe COVID-19. In our case, the history of a recent compatible illness, with multiple family members affected at the same time and high daily caseloads suggest recent infection. Renal involvement in patients with MIS-C can manifest as proteinuria, haematuria and AKI. AKI has been reported in quarter to one-third of patients with MIS-C. McCulloch et al. have described a 9-year-old boy with MIS-C requiring PD. In one of the largest series of AKI in MIS-C (57 children with MIS-C), only 1 required dialysis. AKI may occur due to direct viral tropism to renal parenchyma, haemodynamic compromise, cytokine storm and multiorgan dysfunction. High levels of ACE2 receptor expression in proximal tubular epithelial cells may be responsible for viral tropism and kidney injury. To conclude, AKI requiring renal replacement therapy is an unusual presentation of MIS-C.",Journal of Paediatrics and Child Health,2021,secondary,doi:10.1111/jpc.15715,34467603,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1111/jpc.15715,
doi:10.1080/17474124.2023.2295496,Risankizumab to treat moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in adults: an evaluation of trials and data.,"INTRODUCTION
Risankizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively inhibits interleukin (IL)-23. It is approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and more recently moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease (CD).


AREAS COVERED
After examining the current landscape of CD management including therapies which are currently approved and those in late stages of development, we will review the interleukin pathway and discuss the specific mechanism of targeted IL-23 inhibition, summarize available clinical trial data on efficacy and safety of Risankizumab, consider future positioning of Risankizumab in the therapeutic armamentarium, and ultimately discuss future needs for the field.


EXPERT OPINION
Risankizumab represents the first and only targeted IL-23 inhibitor approved for the treatment of CD, providing a promising addition to the therapeutic armamentarium for CD, with a favorable safety profile and demonstrated efficacy in both biologic-naïve and exposed populations. It is possible that the targeted nature of Risankizumab may enhance efficacy and safety over combined IL-12/23 inhibition, with trials underway attempting to shed light on that hypothesis.",Expert review of gastroenterology & hepatology,2023,secondary,doi:10.1080/17474124.2023.2295496,38095092,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1080/17474124.2023.2295496,

We present a 12-year-old boy with a history of fever, vomiting, diarrhoea, and abdominal pain. He developed shock with ventricular dysfunction and pericardial effusion. He was diagnosed with multisystemic inflammatory syndrome in children and treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins, corticosteroids, and tocilizumab proved to be ineffective. Eventually, the patient responded to cyclosporin-A treatment. Multisystemic inflammatory syndrome in children has been treated with immunoglobulins and glucocorticoids and in refractory cases biologics and cyclosporin-A have been used. Intravenous and oral cyclosporin-A seems to be a safe and effective alternative treatment for refractory multisystemic inflammatory syndrome in children patients.",Cardiology in the young,2022,secondary,doi:10.1017/S1047951122002748,36052505,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1017/S1047951122002748,

In a recent technical pilot, we compare the performance of traditional short-read sequencing with long-read sequencing in a small cohort of samples from the HapMap project and two AoU control samples representing eight datasets. Our analysis reveals substantial differences in the ability of these technologies to accurately sequence complex medically relevant genes, particularly in terms of gene coverage and pathogenic variant identification. We also consider the advantages and challenges of using low coverage sequencing to increase sample numbers in large cohort analysis. Our results show that HiFi reads produce the most accurate results for both small and large variants. Further, we present a cloud-based pipeline to optimize SNV, indel and SV calling at scale for long-reads analysis. These results lead to widespread improvements across AoU.

The main problem comes when SARS-CoV-2 gets mutated with the rising infection and becomes more lethal for humankind than ever. Mutations in the structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2, i.e., the spike surface glycoprotein (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N), and replication machinery enzymes, i.e., main protease (Mpro) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) creating more complexities towards pathogenesis and the available COVID-19 therapeutic strategies. This study analyzes how a minimal variation in these enzymes, especially in S protein at the genomic/proteomic level, affects pathogenesis. The structural variations are discussed in light of the failure of small molecule development in COVID-19 therapeutic strategies. We have performed in-depth sequence- and structure-based analyses of these proteins to get deeper insights into the mechanism of pathogenesis, structure-function relationships, and development of modern therapeutic approaches.

doi:10.1021/acssensors.3c01922,Tumor-Targeted Fluorescent/Photoacoustic Imaging of Legumain Activity In Vivo.,"Legumain has been identified as a target for diagnosis and treatment of associated cancers. Therefore, real-time imaging of legumain activity in vivo is helpful in diagnosing and evaluating therapeutic efficacy of associated cancers. Fluorescent/photoacoustic (FL/PA) dual-modal imaging developed rapidly because of its good sensitivity and spatial resolution. As far as we know, a tumor-targeted probe for FL/PA imaging of legumain activity in vivo has not been reported. Hence, we intended to develop a tumor-targeted hemicyanine (HCy) probe (HCy-AAN-Bio) for FL/PA imaging of legumain in vivo. The control probe HCy-AAN does not have tumor-targeting ability. Legumain can specifically cleave HCy-AAN-Bio or HCy-AAN with the generation of FL/PA signal while more HCy-AAN-Bio could be recognized by legumain than HCy-AAN with higher sensitivity in vitro. Due to the tumor-targeting ability, HCy-AAN-Bio could image 4T1 cells with an additional 1.3-fold FL enhancement and 1.9-fold PA enhancement than HCy-AAN. In addition, HCy-AAN-Bio could image legumain activity in vivo with an additional 1.5-fold FL enhancement and 1.9-fold PA enhancement than HCy-AAN.

This has become a popular strategy for developing analytical biosensors relying on this quenching process for signal transduction. Here, we report on the use of stable PEGylated gold nanoparticles, covalently coupled to dye-labeled peptides, as sensitive optically addressable sensors for determining the catalytic efficiency of the human matrix metalloproteinase-14 (MMP-14), a cancer biomarker. We exploit real-time dye PL recovery triggered by MMP-14 hydrolysis of the AuNP-peptide-dye to extract quantitative analysis of the proteolysis kinetics. Sub-nanomolar limit of detections for MMP-14 has been achieved using our hybrid bioconjugates. In addition, we have used theoretical considerations within a diffusion-collision framework to derive enzyme substrate hydrolysis and inhibition kinetics equations, which allowed us to describe the complexity and irregularity of enzymatic proteolysis of nanosurface-immobilized peptide substrates. Our findings offer a great strategy for the development of highly sensitive and stable biosensors for cancer detection and imaging.",Journal of the American Chemical Society,2023,secondary,doi:10.1021/jacs.2c12032,36802544,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1021/jacs.2c12032,

The cryo-electron microscopy structure of a soluble prefusion-stabilized spike reveals the P.1 trimer to adopt exclusively a conformation in which one of the receptor-binding domains is in the “up” position, with the functional impact of mutations appearing to arise from local changes instead of global conformational alterations.

doi:10.3390/molecules28041704,Aggregation-Based Bacterial Separation with Gram-Positive Selectivity by Using a Benzoxaborole-Modified Dendrimer,"Antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bacteria have become a critical global issue in recent years. The inefficacy of antimicrobial agents against AMR bacteria has led to increased difficulty in treating many infectious diseases. Analyses of the environmental distribution of bacteria are important for monitoring the AMR problem, and a rapid as well as viable pH- and temperature-independent bacterial separation method is required for collecting and concentrating bacteria from environmental samples. Thus, we aimed to develop a useful and selective bacterial separation method using a chemically synthesized nanoprobe. The metal-free benzoxaborole-based dendrimer probe BenzoB-PAMAM(+), which was synthesized from carboxy-benzoxaborole and a poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimer, could help achieve Gram-positive bacterial separation by recognizing Gram-positive bacterial surfaces over a wide pH range, leading to the formation of large aggregations. The recognition site of benzoxaborole has a desirable high acidity and may therefore be responsible for the improved Gram-positive selectivity. The Gram-positive bacterial aggregation was then successfully collected by using a 10 μm membrane filter, with Gram-negative bacteria remaining in the filtrate solution. BenzoB-PAMAM(+) will thus be useful for application in biological analyses and could contribute to further investigations of bacterial distributions in environmental soil or water.",Molecules,2023,secondary,doi:10.3390/molecules28041704,36838690,9958924,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/molecules28041704,

This study examines primary reports of pediatric AHUE cases and summarizes the proposed etiologies. This systematic review collected and evaluated published peer-reviewed articles, official data, and clinical reports of AHUE cases that met the WHO working case definition. 19 hypothesized etiologies for AHUE were identified from 36 sources, which fell into eight categories.

Considering the origin of the studies performed (low-, middle- and high-income countries), a systematic scoping review was conducted with primary studies that reported the use of medications for the treatment of patients with MIS-C. Sources: The searches were performed in MEDLINE, Embase, Lilacs, Epistemonikos, CINAHL, and CENTRAL, in the grey literature (theses and dissertations from CAPES, ProQuest, and PROSPERO) and in clinical trial databases until May 2022. The selection and extraction of studies were performed independently by two reviewers. Summary of the findings: A total of 173 studies were included, most of which were published as case reports or series. No randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) were identified. The investigated drugs were immunoglobulins, glucocorticoids, monoclonal antibodies, anticoagulants, and antiplatelet agents.

The main findings from this study and shows that, compared to the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, mutations E484A/G/K/Q/R/V, Q493K/L/R, S494A/P/R, L452R and F490S are predicted to be markedly resistant to neutralization by LY-CoV555, while mutations K417E/N/T, D420A/G/N, N460I/K/S/T, T415P, and Y489C/S are predicted to confer LY-CoV016 escaping advantage to the viral protein. A challenge of our global in silico results against the relevant experimental data resulted in an overall 90% agreement. This achievement not only constitutes a further, robust validation of our computer-based approach but also yields a molecular-based rationale for all relative experimental findings, and leads us to conclude that the current circulating SARS-CoV-2 and all possible emergent variants carrying these mutations in the spike protein can present new challenges for mAb-based therapies and ultimately threaten the fully-protective efficacy of currently available vaccines.",bioRxiv,2021,secondary,doi:10.1101/2021.05.18.444605,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2021.05.18.444605,

Understanding the viral lineages that constitute the infections in a population can uncover the origins and transmission patterns of outbreaks and detect the emergence of novel variants that may impact the course of an epidemic. Population-level surveillance of viruses through genomic sequencing of wastewater captures unbiased lineage data, including cryptic asymptomatic and undiagnosed infections, and has been shown to detect infection outbreaks and novel variant emergence before detection in clinical samples. Here, we present an optimised protocol for quantification and sequencing of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in influent wastewater, used for high-throughput genomic surveillance in England during the COVID-19 pandemic. This protocol utilises reverse compliment PCR for library preparation, enabling tiled amplification across the whole viral genome and sequencing adapter addition in a single step to enhance efficiency. Sequencing of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA provided evidence validating the efficacy of this protocol, while data from high-throughput sequencing of wastewater samples demonstrated the sensitivity of this method. We also provided guidance on the quality control steps required during library preparation and data analysis.

We hypothesized that aberrant virus–specific T cell responses contribute to MIS-C pathogenesis. We quantified SARS-CoV-2–reactive T cells, serologic responses against major viral proteins, and cytokine responses from plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells in children with convalescent COVID-19, in children with acute MIS-C, and in healthy controls. Children with MIS-C had significantly lower virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses to major SARS-CoV-2 antigens compared with children convalescing from COVID-19. Furthermore, T cell responses in participants with MIS-C were similar to or lower than those in healthy controls. Serologic responses against spike receptor binding domain (RBD), full-length spike, and nucleocapsid were similar among convalescent COVID-19 and MIS-C, suggesting functional B cell responses. Cytokine profiling demonstrated predominant Th1 polarization of CD4+ T cells from children with convalescent COVID-19 and MIS-C, although cytokine production was reduced in MIS-C.

Bacterial culture is the standard method for assessing the risk of exposure to pathogens in urban environments, but this method only accounts for <1% of the diversity of bacteria. Recently, full-length 16S rRNA gene analysis using nanopore sequencing has been applied for microbial evaluations, resulting in a rise in the development of long-read taxonomic tools for species-level classification. Regarding their comparative performance, there is, however, a lack of information. Methods Here, we aim to analyze the concordance of the microbial community in the urban environment inferred by multiple taxonomic classifiers, including ARGpore2, Emu, Kraken2/Bracken and NanoCLUST, using our 16S-nanopore dataset generated by MegaBLAST, as well as assess their abilities to identify culturable species based on the conventional culture results. Results According to our results, NanoCLUST was preferred for 16S microbial profiling because it had a high concordance of dominant species and a similar microbial profile to MegaBLAST, whereas Kraken2/Bracken, which had similar clustering results as NanoCLUST, was also desirable. Second, for culturable species identification, Emu with the highest accuracy (81.2%) and F1 score (29%) for the detection of culturable species was suggested.

Findings from a North Carolina statewide analysis, based on 62 wk of wastewater data, suggest that officials should combine multiple wastewater metrics to characterize COVID-19 dynamics. After considering patterns across several metrics, we developed a simple algorithm that successfully identified the start of two very different variant-based surges.

The existence of toxic substances to bacteria, such as antibiotics, biocides, and heavy metals, may influence the pathway into the genome. This study aimed to detect the presence of antibiotic-resistance bacteria in air particulates in Makassar - a provincial capital located in Indonesia with a low to moderate air quality index (AQI). We determined the correlations between antibiotic resistance (resistance rate, RR) and the heavy-metal concentrations in the air particulates. Air particulate samples were taken from seven locations in the summer (Dry Season: July - August 2019). We analyzed the concentration of As, Cu, and Zn of the air particulates and determined RR from presumptive Escherichia coli (E. coli) isolated from the air particulates. We estimated the RR towards five antibiotics with different mechanisms of action: amoxicillin-clavulanate, chloramphenicol, amikacin, norfloxacin, and trimethoprim. The concentrations of the heavy metals were relatively low, ranging from (µg/Nm3) 0.001 – 0.009 for As, 0.001 – 0.003 for Cu, and 0.007 to 0.783 for Zn. We observed different antibiotic resistance at various locations, ranging from 25% to 100% RR. While there were indications of possible antibiotic resistance patterns in the different areas sampled, the power of this perspective snapshot was insufficient to make statistically valid generalizations.",Jurnal Kimia Valensi,2022,secondary,doi:10.15408/jkv.v8i1.24559,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.15408/jkv.v8i1.24559,

Such patient stratification can be facilitated using multiple markers, including SARS-CoV-2-specific viral enzymes, like the 3CL protease, and viral-life-cycle-associated host proteins, such as ACE2. To enable future explorations, we have developed a fluorescent and Raman spectroscopic SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease assay that can be run sequentially with a fluorescent ACE2 activity measurement within the same sample. Our prototype assay functions well in saliva, enabling non-invasive sampling. ACE2 and 3CL protease activity can be run with minimal sample volumes in 30 min. To test the prototype, a small initial cohort of eight clinical samples was used to check if the assay could differentiate COVID-19-positive and -negative samples. Though these small clinical cohort samples did not reach statistical significance, results trended as expected. The high sensitivity of the assay also allowed the detection of a low-activity 3CL protease mutant.",Biosensors,2023,secondary,doi:10.3390/bios13070682,37504081,10377347,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/bios13070682,

In the Philippines, geographical and economic access to quality diagnostic testing remains out of reach for many communities. We describe the preclinical development of a fluorescence-based reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification test that uses drooled saliva as the biospecimen. Six treat-and-heat (""direct"") procedures that inactivate the virus and release the target RNA were compared. Using duplexed As1e and E1 primers, protocols derived from Ben-Assa et al. (2020) using proteinase K or from Rabe and Cepko (2020) using TCEP (Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride)/EDTA provided reliable RNA amplification. The TCEP/EDTA-based method in particular showed improvement in robustness in duplex vs. singleplex format. Inclusion of human β-actin primers provided a triplex test with an internal amplification control that could be distinguished from SARS-CoV-2 amplicons based on melt curve analysis. After including the dUTP/uracil-DNA glycosylase system and implementing laboratory procedures to avoid cross-contamination, false positive amplification was acceptably rare. The duplex or triplex tests are predicted to reliably detect patient salivary viral loads >100 copies/μL and to yield equivocal results between 10 and 100 copies/μL. These viral loads, corresponding to RT-qPCR C t ∼29-32, are expected to identify the majority of infected and, particularly, of infectious patients.

doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btad690,PLM-ARG: antibiotic resistance gene identification using a pretrained protein language model,"Abstract Motivation Antibiotic resistance presents a formidable global challenge to public health and the environment. While considerable endeavors have been dedicated to identify antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) for assessing the threat of antibiotic resistance, recent extensive investigations using metagenomic and metatranscriptomic approaches have unveiled a noteworthy concern. A significant fraction of proteins defies annotation through conventional sequence similarity-based methods, an issue that extends to ARGs, potentially leading to their under-recognition due to dissimilarities at the sequence level. Results Herein, we proposed an Artificial Intelligence-powered ARG identification framework using a pretrained large protein language model, enabling ARG identification and resistance category classification simultaneously. The proposed PLM-ARG was developed based on the most comprehensive ARG and related resistance category information (>28K ARGs and associated 29 resistance categories), yielding Matthew’s correlation coefficients (MCCs) of 0.983 ± 0.001 by using a 5-fold cross-validation strategy. Furthermore, the PLM-ARG model was verified using an independent validation set and achieved an MCC of 0.838, outperforming other publicly available ARG prediction tools with an improvement range of 51.8%–107.9%. Moreover, the utility of the proposed PLM-ARG model was demonstrated by annotating resistance in the UniProt database and evaluating the impact of ARGs on the Earth's environmental microbiota.

Microbial composition and abundance affect bee health through nutrition, immunity, and fitness. In ever-expanding urban landscapes, land use development changes bee habitats and floral resource availability, thus altering the sources of microbes that wild bees need to establish their microbiome. Here, we implement metabarcoding of the bacterial 16S and fungal ITS regions to characterize the diversity and composition of the microbiome in 58 small carpenter bees, Ceratina calcarata, across urban land use gradients (study area 6,425 km2). By categorizing land use development, green space, precipitation, and temperature variables as indicators of habitat across the city, we found that land use variables can predict microbial diversity. Microbial composition was also found to vary across urban land use gradients, with certain microbes such as Acinetobacter and Apilactobacillus overrepresented in less urban locations and Penicillium more abundant in developed areas. Environmental features may also lead to differences in microbe interactions, as co-occurrences between bacteria and fungi varied across percent land use development, exemplified by the correlation between Methylobacterium and Sphingomonas being more prevalent in areas of higher urban development. Surrounding landscapes change the microbial landscape in wild bees and alter the relationships they have with their microbiome. As such, urban centres should consider the impact of growing cities on their pollinators’ health and protect wild bees from the effects of anthropogenic activities.",Frontiers in Microbiology,2022,secondary,doi:10.3389/fmicb.2022.992660,36466654,9714450,https://doi.org/doi:10.3389/fmicb.2022.992660,

The key for returning to normalcy is to avoid affecting social and economic activities while supporting precise epidemic control. Estimation models for the spatiotemporal spread of the epidemic at the refined scale of cities that support precise epidemic control are limited. For most of 2021, Hong Kong has remained at the top of the “global normalcy index” because of its effective responses. The urban-community-scale spatiotemporal onset risk prediction model of COVID-19 symptom has been used to assist in the precise epidemic control of Hong Kong. Objective Based on the spatiotemporal prediction models of COVID-19 symptom onset risk, the aim of this study was to develop a spatiotemporal solution to assist in precise prevention and control for returning to normalcy. Methods Over the years 2020 and 2021, a spatiotemporal solution was proposed and applied to support the epidemic control in Hong Kong. An enhanced urban-community-scale geographic model was proposed to predict the risk of COVID-19 symptom onset by quantifying the impact of the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 variants, vaccination, and the imported case risk. The generated prediction results could be then applied to establish the onset risk predictions over the following days, the identification of high–onset-risk communities, the effectiveness analysis of response measures implemented, and the effectiveness simulation of upcoming response measures. The applications could be integrated into a web-based platform to assist the antiepidemic work. Results Daily predicted onset risk in 291 tertiary planning units (TPUs) of Hong Kong from January 18, 2020, to April 22, 2021, was obtained from the enhanced prediction model. The prediction accuracy in the following 7 days was over 80%. The prediction results were used to effectively assist the epidemic control of Hong Kong in the following application examples: identified communities within high–onset-risk always only accounted for 2%-25% in multiple epidemiological scenarios; effective COVID-19 response measures, such as prohibiting public gatherings of more than 4 people were found to reduce the onset risk by 16%-46%; through the effect simulation of the new compulsory testing measure, the onset risk was found to be reduced by more than 80% in 42 (14.43%) TPUs and by more than 60% in 96 (32.99%) TPUs. Conclusions In summary, this solution can support sustainable and targeted pandemic responses for returning to normalcy. Faced with the situation that may coexist with SARS-CoV-2, this study can not only assist global cities in responding to the future epidemics effectively but also help to restore social and economic activities and people’s normal lives.",JMIR Public Health and Surveillance,2022,secondary,doi:10.2196/36538,36508488,9829029,https://doi.org/doi:10.2196/36538,

Pulmonary involvement with acute respiratory failure is an unusual life-threatening complication of MIS-C, often a reason for admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and the use of mechanical ventilation. We present a case of a 7-year-old male patient, previously healthy, hospitalized for MIS-C, treated with intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), high dose methylprednisolone, and anakinra. After 2 days of the aforementioned therapy, the patient presented with hypoxia (SatO2: 85% in ambient air room) and breathing difficulties. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed the presence of multiple bilateral basal parenchymal thickening and small basal pleural effusion and an arterial blood gas analysis revealed severe hypoxia (PaO2/FiO2 ratio, 170 mmHg). Because of a worsening of respiratory distress, the patient was transferred to the PICU, where invasive mechanical ventilation and a continuous infusion of anakinra (12 mg/kg/day) were started. An echocardiogram was performed, which showed an increase in pulmonary pressure (40 mmHg) with normal heart ejection fraction (55%), and the hypothesis of pulmonary vasculitis involving the pulmonary arterioles was made. Therefore, therapy with sildenafil (0.15 mg/kg/day) was promptly set up, with an immediate improvement of the clinical picture of respiratory failure, reduction of pulmonary pressure (23 mmHg), and subsequent extubation at 36 h with a regular clinical course until discharge. As far as we know, our case represents the first report of pulmonary vasculitis in an MIS-C patient. The use of sildenafil and high-dose continuous anakinra may represent a rescue therapy in cases of MIS-C with pulmonary vasculitis or with difficulty in extubation, allowing a short-term hospitalization in intensive care and improving the long-term outcome in these patients.",Frontiers in Pediatrics,2023,secondary,doi:10.3389/fped.2022.1015617,36644405,9835840,https://doi.org/doi:10.3389/fped.2022.1015617,

Fractional dosing by intradermal administration (ID) has been shown to be equally immunogenic as intramuscular (IM) for several vaccines, but the immunogenicity of ID inactivated whole-virus SARS-CoV-2 at the full dose is unknown. This study (NCT04800133) investigated the superiority of antibody and T cell responses of full-dose CoronaVac by ID over IM in adolescents. Participants aged 11-17 years received 2 doses IM or ID, followed by the 3rd dose 13-42 days later. Humoral and cellular immunogenicity outcomes were measured post-dose 2 (IM-CC versus ID-CC) and post-dose 3 (IM-CCC versus ID-CCC). Doses 2 and 3 were administered to 173 and 104 adolescents, respectively. S IgG, S-RBD IgG, S IgG Fc{gamma}RIIIa-binding, SNM-specific IL-2+CD4+, SNM-specific IL-2+CD8+, S-specific IL-2+CD8+, N-specific IL-2+CD4+, N-specific IL-2+CD8+ and M-specific IL-2+CD4+ responses fulfilled the superior and non-inferior criteria for ID-CC compared to IM-CC, whereas IgG avidity was inferior. For ID-CCC, S-RBD IgG, surrogate virus neutralisation test (sVNT), 90% plaque reduction neutralisation titre (PRNT90), PRNT50, S IgG avidity, S IgG Fc{gamma}RIIIa-binding, M-specific IL-2+CD4+, interferon-{gamma}+CD8+ and IL-2+CD8+ responses were superior and non-inferior to IM-CCC. The estimated vaccine efficacies were 49%, 52%, 66% and 79% for IM-CC, ID-CC, IM-CCC and ID-CCC, respectively. More in the ID groups reported local, mild adverse reactions.

We use a mathematical framework to model within-host viral dynamics and test different criteria for ending isolation. By considering a fixed time of 10 days since symptom onset as the criterion for ending isolation, we estimated that the risk of releasing an individual who is still infectious is low (0–6.6%). However, this policy entails lengthy unnecessary isolations (4.8–8.3 days). In contrast, by using a personalized strategy, similar low risks can be reached with shorter prolonged isolations. The obtained findings provide a scientific rationale for policies on ending the isolation of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals.",eLife,2021,secondary,doi:10.7554/eLife.69340,34311842,8315804,https://doi.org/doi:10.7554/eLife.69340,
doi:10.37757/mr2022.v24.n3-4.10,A Shift in SARS-CoV-2 Omicron Variant's Entry Pathway Might Explain Different Clinical Outcomes.,"Globally, SARS CoV-2 omicron variant has led to a notable increase of COVID-19 diagnoses, although with less severe clinical manifestations and decreased hospitalizations. The omicron wave swelled faster than previous waves, completely displacing the delta variant within weeks, and creating worldwide concern about final, successful pandemic control. Some authors contend that symptoms associated to omicron differ from 'traditional' symptoms and more closely resemble those of the common cold. One major COVID-19 symptom frequent with other variants-loss of taste and smell-is rarely present with omicron. This may be of interest, since it has also been suggested that direct SARS-CoV-2 invasion into the brainstem through the olfactory nerves by transsynaptic pathways could provide one explanation for the acute respiratory distress syndrome refractory to treatment. Brainstem infection by SARS-CoV-2 can severely damage the respiratory center, triggering functional deviations that affect involuntary respiration, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome refractory to treatment, the main cause of death in COVID-19 patients. A shift in the omicron SARS-CoV-2 entry pathway from cell-surface fusion, triggered by TMPRSS2, to cathepsin-dependent fusion within the endosome, may affect transmission, cellular tropism and pathogenesis. Therefore, we can hypothesize that this entrance modification may impact transmission from the olfactory nerve to the brainstem through transsynaptic pathways. A decrement of the virus's direct invasion into the brainstem could diminish respiratory center dysfunction, reducing acute respiratory distress syndrome and the need for mechanical ventilation.",MEDICC review,2022,secondary,doi:10.37757/mr2022.v24.n3-4.10,36417338,,https://doi.org/doi:10.37757/mr2022.v24.n3-4.10,

Grab (quantitative) and passive samples (qualitative) are two distinct wastewater sampling methods. Although many viral concentration methods such as the usage of membrane filtration and skim milk are reported, these methods generally require large volumes of wastewater, expensive lab equipment, and laborious processes. Methods The objectives of this study were to compare two workflows (Nanotrap® Microbiome A Particles coupled with MagMax kit and membrane filtration workflows coupled with RNeasy kit) for SARS-CoV-2 recovery in grab samples and two workflows (Nanotrap® Microbiome A Particles and skim milk workflows coupled with MagMax kit) for SARS-CoV-2 recovery in Moore swab samples. The Nanotrap particle workflow was initially evaluated with and without the addition of the enhancement reagent 1 (ER1) in 10 mL wastewater. RT-qPCR targeting the nucleocapsid protein was used for detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Results Adding ER1 to wastewater prior to viral concentration significantly improved viral concentration results (P < 0.0001) in 10 mL grab and swab samples processed by automated or manual Nanotrap workflows. SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in 10 mL grab and Moore swab samples with ER1 processed by the automated workflow as a whole showed significantly higher (P < 0.001) results than 150 mL grab samples using the membrane filtration workflow and 250 mL swab samples using the skim milk workflow, respectively. Spiking known genome copies (GC) of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 into 10 mL wastewater indicated that the limit of detection of the automated Nanotrap workflow was ~11.5 GC/mL using the RT-qPCR and 115 GC/mL using the digital PCR methods. Discussion These results suggest that Nanotrap workflows could substitute the traditional membrane filtration and skim milk workflows for viral concentration without compromising the assay sensitivity. The manual workflow can be used in resource-limited areas, and the automated workflow is appropriate for large-scale COVID-19 wastewater-based surveillance.",Frontiers in Microbiology,2023,secondary,doi:10.3389/fmicb.2023.1215311,37476666,10354513,https://doi.org/doi:10.3389/fmicb.2023.1215311,

Compared to the previous strains of β-CoV genera- MERS and SARS, SARS-CoV-2 has significantly higher transmissibility and worst post-recovery implications. A frequent mutation in the initial SARS-CoV-2 strain has been a major cause of mortalities (approx. 3 million deaths) and uncontrolled virulence (approx. 1 billion positive cases). As far as clinical manifestations are concerned, this particular virus has exhibited deleterious impacts on systems other than the respiratory system (primary target organ), such as the brain, hematological system, liver, kidneys, endocrine system, etc. with no promising curatives to date. Lack of emergency treatments and shortage of life-saving drugs has promoted the repurposing of existing therapeutics along with the emergence of vaccines with the combined efforts of scientists and industrial experts in this short span.

To overcome this, we repurposed a cloud platform initially designed for use in research on cancer genomics (https://cgc.sbgenomics.com) to enable its use in research on SARS-CoV-2 to build Cloud Workflow for Viral and Variant Identification (COWID). COWID is a workflow based on the Common Workflow Language that realizes the full potential of sequencing technology for use in reliable SARS-CoV-2 identification and leverages cloud computing to achieve efficient parallelization. COWID outperformed other contemporary methods for identification by offering scalable identification and reliable variant findings with no false-positive results. COWID typically processed each sample of raw sequencing data within 5 min at a cost of only US$0.01. The COWID source code is publicly available (https://github.com/hendrick0403/COWID) and can be accessed on any computer with Internet access.

We report here that olfactory receptor 558 (Olfr558), which has not previously been studied in non-olfactory tissues, localizes to vascular smooth muscle cells in numerous tissues including the kidney and heart. In the kidney, Olfr558 colocalizes with renin (a hormone that plays a key role in blood pressure regulation) in the renal afferent arteriole. Based on the localization of Olfr558, we hypothesized that Olfr558 plays a role in blood pressure regulation. We find that sex differences in blood pressure are intact in Olfr558 wildtype (WT) mice, but, are absent in Olfr558 knockout (KO) mice. We find that male KO mice have lowered diastolic blood pressure, decreased renin expression and activity, and altered vascular reactivity. Female KO mice exhibit increased blood pressure and increased pulse wave velocity, indicating increased vascular stiffness. The human ortholog of Olfr558, OR51E1, was previously identified as a locus associated with diastolic blood pressure. We report here that a rare OR51E1 missense variant has a statistically significant sex interaction effect with diastolic blood pressure, increasing diastolic blood pressure in women but decreasing it in men. In addition, we characterize how two different clinically relevant OR51E1 variants influence OR51E1 signaling in vitro. In sum, our findings demonstrate an evolutionarily conserved role for Olfr558/OR51E1 to mediate sex differences in blood pressure by altering renin, vascular reactivity, and arterial stiffness.",bioRxiv,2022,secondary,doi:10.1101/2022.11.16.516677,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2022.11.16.516677,

The subspecies T. b. gambiense is mainly responsible for mostly chronic anthroponotic infections in West- and Central Africa, accounting for roughly 95% of all HAT cases. Trypanosoma b. rhodesiense results in more acute zoonotic infections in East-Africa. Because HAT has a two-stage pathogenesis, treatment depends on clinical assessment of patients and the determination whether or not parasites have crossed the blood brain barrier. Today, ultimate confirmation of parasitemia is still done by microscopy analysis. However, the introduction of diagnostic lateral flow devices has been a major contributor to the recent dramatic drop in T. b. gambiense HAT. Other techniques such as loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and recombinant polymerase amplification (RPA)-based tests have been published but are still not widely used in the field. Most recently, CRISPR-Cas technology has been proposed to improve the intrinsic diagnostic characteristics of molecular approaches. This will become crucial in the near future, as preventing the resurgence of HAT will be a priority and will require tools with extreme high positive and negative predicted values, as well as excellent sensitivity and specificity. As for treatment, pentamidine and suramin have historically been the drugs of choice for the treatment of blood-stage gambiense-HAT and rhodesiense-HAT, respectively. For treatment of second-stage infections, drugs that pass the blood brain barrier are needed, and melarsoprol has been effectively used for both forms of HAT in the past. However, due to the high occurrence of post-treatment encephalopathy, the drug is not recommended for use in T. b. gambiense HAT. Here, a combination therapy of eflornithine and nifurtimox (NECT) has been the choice of treatment since 2009. As this treatment requires IV perfusion of eflornithine, efforts were launched in 2003 by the drugs for neglected disease initiative (DNDi) to find an oral-only therapy solution, suitable for rural sub-Saharan Africa treatment conditions. In 2019 this resulted in the introduction of fexinidazole, with a treatment regimen suitable for both the blood-stage and non-severe second-stage T. b. gambiense infections.

KD development is known to be associated with an aberrant immune response and abnormal platelet activation, however its etiology is still largely unknown. Myosin light chain 9 (Myl9) is known to regulate cellular contractility of both non-muscle and smooth muscle cells, and can be released from platelets, whereas any relations of Myl9 expression to KD vasculitis have not been examined. Methods Plasma Myl9 concentrations in KD patients and children with febrile illness were measured and associated with KD clinical course and prognosis. Myl9 release from platelets in KD patients was also evaluated in vitro. Myl9 expression was determined in coronary arteries from Lactobacillus casei cell wall extract (LCWE)-injected mice that develop experimental KD vasculitis, as well as in cardiac tissues obtained at autopsy from KD patients. Results and discussion Plasma Myl9 levels were significantly higher in KD patients during the acute phase compared with healthy controls or patients with other febrile illnesses, declined following IVIG therapy in IVIG-responders but not in non-responders. In vitro, platelets from KD patients released Myl9 independently of thrombin stimulation. In the LCWE-injected mice, Myl9 was detected in cardiac tissue at an early stage before inflammatory cell infiltration was observed. In tissues obtained at autopsy from KD patients, the highest Myl9 expression was observed in thrombi during the acute phase and in the intima and adventitia of coronary arteries during the chronic phase. Thus, our studies show that Myl9 expression is significantly increased during KD vasculitis and that Myl9 levels may be a useful biomarker to estimate inflammation and IVIG responsiveness to KD.",Frontiers in Immunology,2023,secondary,doi:10.3389/fimmu.2022.1036672,36685558,9853906,https://doi.org/doi:10.3389/fimmu.2022.1036672,

The currently used methods for the probing of Mpro activity and the screening of its inhibitors require the use of a double-labeled peptide substrate. In this work, we suggested that the label-free peptide substrate could induce the aggregation of AuNPs through the electrostatic interactions, and the cleavage of the peptide by the Mpro inhibited the aggregation of AuNPs. This fact allowed for the visual analysis of Mpro activity by observing the color change of the AuNPs suspension. Furthermore, the co-assembly of AuNPs and peptide was achieved on the peptide-covered electrode surface. Cleavage of the peptide substrate by the Mpro limited the formation of AuNPs/peptide assembles, thus allowing for the development of a simple and sensitive electrochemical method for Mpro detection in serum samples. The change of the electrochemical signal was easily monitored by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).

The practical challenges, however, have often led to testing only symptomatic individuals and their close contacts. As many countries plan for a cautious relaxation of social restrictions, more effective approaches for widescale testing are increasingly important. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, laboratories in several countries demonstrated the feasibility of detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection by pooled testing, which combines the specimens from several individuals. Since no further testing is needed for individuals in a negative pool, there is potential for greater efficiency of testing. Despite validations of the accuracy of the results and the efficiency in testing specific groups, the benefits of pooling are less acknowledged as a population surveillance strategy that can detect new disease outbreaks without posing restrictions on entire societies. Pooling specimens from natural clusters, such as school classes, sports teams, workplace colleagues and other social networks, would enable timely and cost-effective widescale testing for SARS-CoV-2. The initial result would be readily translatable into action in terms of quarantine and isolation policies. Clusters of uninfected individuals would be quickly identified and immediate local lockdown of positive clusters would be the appropriate and sufficient action while retesting those individuals. By adapting to the social networks of a population, pooled testing offers a cost-efficient surveillance system that is synchronized with quarantine policies that are rational, risk-based and equitable.",Bulletin of the World Health Organization,2021,secondary,doi:10.2471/BLT.20.283093,34621088,8477423,https://doi.org/doi:10.2471/BLT.20.283093,

To decipher the mechanism of pathogenesis by the BA.1 × AY.4 recombinant variant (Deltacron), a protein coupling, protein structural graphs (PSG), residue communication and all atoms simulation protocols were used. We observed that the bonding network is altered by this variant; engaging new residues that helps to robustly bind. HADDOCK docking score for the wild type has been previously reported to be −111.8 ± 1.5 kcal/mol while the docking score for the Deltacron variant was calculated to be −128.3 ± 2.5 kcal/mol. The protein structural graphs revealed variations in the hub residues, number of nodes, inter and intra residues communities, and path communication perturbation caused by the acquired mutations in the Deltacron-RBD thus alter the binding approach and infectivity. Moreover, the dynamic behaviour reported a highly flexible structure with enhanced residues flexibility particularly by the loops required for interaction with ACE2. It was observed that these mutations have altered the secondary structure of the RBD mostly transited to the loops thus acquired higher flexible dynamics than the native structure during the simulation. The total binding free energy for each of these complexes, that is, WT-RBD and Deltacron-RBD were reported to be −61.38 kcal/mol and −70.47 kcal/mol. Protein’s motion revealed a high trace value in the Deltacron variant that clearly depict more structural flexibility. The broad range of phase space covered by the Deltacron variant along PC1 and PC2 suggests that these mutations are important in contributing conformational heterogeneity or flexibility that consequently help the variant to bind more efficiently than the wild type.

Here, the Department of Defense Serum Repository (DoDSR), a cohort of over 10 million individuals, was used to generate whole-proteome autoantibody profiles of hundreds of patients with MS (PwMS) years before and subsequently after MS onset. This analysis defines a unique cluster of PwMS that share an autoantibody signature against a common motif that has similarity with many human pathogens. These patients exhibit antibody reactivity years before developing MS symptoms and have higher levels of serum neurofilament light (sNfL) compared to other PwMS. Furthermore, this profile is preserved over time, providing molecular evidence for an immunologically active prodromal period years before clinical onset. This autoantibody reactivity was validated in samples from a separate incident MS cohort in both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum, where it is highly specific for patients eventually diagnosed with MS.

Multiple research informatics systems exist but navigating the numerous applications can be challenging for scientists. This article describes Architecture for Research Computing in Health (ARCH), our institution’s approach for matching investigators with tools and services for obtaining electronic patient data. Materials and Methods Supporting the spectrum of studies from populations to individuals, ARCH delivers a breadth of scientific functions—including but not limited to cohort discovery, electronic data capture, and multi-institutional data sharing—that manifest in specific systems—such as i2b2, REDCap, and PCORnet. Through a consultative process, ARCH staff align investigators with tools with respect to study design, data sources, and cost. Although most ARCH services are available free of charge, advanced engagements require fee for service. Results Since 2016 at Weill Cornell Medicine, ARCH has supported over 1200 unique investigators through more than 4177 consultations.

However, operations of these circuits are slow and highly susceptive to molecular noise such as the interference from bystander DNA strands. Herein, this work investigates the effects of a series of cationic copolymers on DNA catalytic hairpin assembly, a representative toehold-mediated DNA circuit. One copolymer, poly(L -lysine)-graft-dextran, significantly enhances the reaction rate by 30-fold due to its electrostatic interaction with DNA. Moreover, the copolymer considerably alleviates the circuit's dependency on the length and GC content of toehold, thereby enhancing the robustness of circuit operation against molecular noise. The general effectiveness of poly(L -lysine)-graft-dextran is demonstrated through kinetic characterization of a DNA AND logic circuit. Therefore, use of a cationic copolymer is a versatile and efficient approach to enhance the operation rate and robustness of toehold-mediated DNA circuits, paving the way for more flexible design and broader application.",Small,2023,secondary,doi:10.1002/smll.202304091,37340578,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1002/smll.202304091,
doi:10.1001/jamapediatrics.2023.2354,"COVID-19 in Children-Learning From the Past, Planning for the Future.","As of April 2023, over 39 million children worldwide have been infected with SARS-CoV-2.1 Now entering the fourth year after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic in March 2020, children have been at the forefront of dialogues around school closures, mask mandates, and vaccination campaigns. Fundamental to these discussions lies a need to quantify the impact of COVID-19 on children—and in order to optimize child health now and in the future, we must learn from our past. In this issue of JAMA Pediatrics, Ward and colleagues2 present a multiyear study characterizing the epidemiology of hospital and pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admissions among children and young people with COVID-19 and pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (Paediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome [PIMS-TS], also referred to as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children in England). Using national data reflecting 98% of hospitalizations and leveraging several linked data sources to systematically capture SARS-CoV-2 testing, PICU admissions, deaths, and prior COVID-19 vaccination or infection, the authors identified 10 540 hospitalizations between February 2020 and January 2022 in which COVID-19 was the primary reason for hospitalization. Of these, 448 children were admitted to the PICU (4.3%) and 48 died within 28 days of admission (0.46%). An additional 997 children with PIMS-TS were identified and nearly half (437 patients [44%]) necessitated PICU admission, while no children with PIMS-TS died. Based on these findings, the authors concluded that PICU utilization and mortality among children with SARS-CoV-2 infection are low in this comprehensive, nationally representative sample. Beyond this, this study captures several epidemiologic nuances with implications for public health, pandemic preparedness, and clinical care for children with COVID-19. First, while severe illness was rare in children overall, a salient finding from this work2 is that the need for PICU admission among children hospitalized with COVID-19 declined over the course of the pandemic with PICU admission occurring in nearly 10% of hospitalized pediatric patients during the wildtype period, 3.4% in the Delta period, and 1.7% in the Omicron period. Similar declines in PICU admissions during the Omicron period relative to earlier variants have been reported in other countries, including in series from the US, Canada, and South Africa.3-7 The consistency of this association across settings increases confidence that there has been true attenuation in illness severity over time, a finding strengthened by the nationally representative data presented in the current study. Furthermore, while the direct contribution of vaccination to the declining trajectory of critical illness is not measurable in this study given that COVID-19 vaccinations were not widely available to children younger than 12 years old during the study period, other reports have demonstrated that vaccination is protective against critical illness due to COVID-19, including studies conducted during the Omicron period.8 Collectively, these findings suggest that at this stage in the pandemic, critical illness due to COVID-19 is extremely rare—and is fortunately largely preventable with vaccines. Second, while declining rates of PICU admission among infected and hospitalized children are certainly reason for optimism, this measure has limitations. To start, estimates of the frequency of PICU admission among hospitalized children vary across studies. For example, using data from COVID-NET, a network of hospitals in 14 US states used to conduct population-based surveillance, 21% of hospitalized children aged 0 to 4 years and 19% of hospitalized children aged 5 to 11 years who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 required PICU admission during the Omicron wave, estimates nearly 15-fold higher than the same age groups in the present study.3,4 There are several possible reasons for these variable findings, including differences in PICU admission threshold across settings, differences in case mix at hospitals participating in surveillance networks vs the nationally representative sample presented in the current study, and variability in inclusion criteria defining the denominator of patients with COVID-19. More objective measures of illness severity, such as a need for mechanical ventilation or vasopressors, may partially improve uniformity in classification of critical illness and therefore prove complementary to quantify PICU resource utilization. Additionally, and particularly for public health and preparedness efforts, population-based estimates of hospitalization and PICU admission rates have additional utility, as these measures reflect changes in absolute numbers of patients requiring hospital-based resources. While population-based estimates (ie, hospitalizations per 100 000 population) were not directly reported in the present study, the absolute number of children aged 0 to 4 years requiring hospitalization in January 2021, the peak of the Omicron phase, was approximately 3-fold and 4-fold higher than the monthly peaks during the Delta and wild-type periods, respectively. Similar trends are borne out in the COVID-NET data, which estimated a 5-fold greater hospitalization rate per 100 000 population during the Omicron phase relative to the Delta phase, while the PICU admission rates were 3.5 times higher.4 Thus, while reassuring that a smaller proportion of infected children developed severe illness, the larger absolute number of children requiring hospitalization or PICU admission may nevertheless strain the Related article Opinion",JAMA pediatrics,2023,secondary,doi:10.1001/jamapediatrics.2023.2354,37523196,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1001/jamapediatrics.2023.2354,

There is a lack of data describing differential expression of immune genes in MIS-C compared to healthy children or those with other inflammatory conditions and how expression changes over time. In this study, we investigated expression of immune-related genes in South African MIS-C patients and controls. Methods The cohort included 30 pre-treatment MIS-C cases and 54 healthy non-inflammatory paediatric controls. Other controls included 34 patients with juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus, Kawasaki disease or other inflammatory conditions. Longitudinal post-treatment MIS-C specimens were available at various timepoints. Expression of 80 immune-related genes was determined by real-time quantitative PCR. Results A total of 29 differentially expressed genes were identified in pre-treatment MIS-C compared to healthy controls. Up-regulated genes were found to be overrepresented in innate immune pathways including interleukin-1 processing and pyroptosis. Post-treatment follow-up data were available for up to 1,200 hours after first treatment. All down-regulated genes and 17/18 up-regulated genes resolved to normal levels in the timeframe, and all patients clinically recovered. When comparing MIS-C to other febrile conditions, only IL27 expression could differentiate these two groups with high sensitivity and specificity. Conclusions These data indicate a unique 29-gene signature of MIS-C in South African children. The up-regulation of interleukin-1 and pyroptosis pathway genes highlights the role of the innate immune system in MIS-C.

A non-invasive and unbiased method is needed to clarify whole body spatiotemporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection after transmission. We recently developed a probe based on the anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody CR3022 to study SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in vivo. Herein, we describe its use in immunoPET to investigate SARS-CoV-2 infection of three rhesus macaques. Using PET/CT imaging of macaques at different times post-SARS-CoV-2 inoculation, we track the 64Cu-labelled CR3022-F(ab’)2 probe targeting the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 to study the dynamics of infection within the respiratory tract and uncover novel sites of infection. Using this method, we uncovered differences in lung pathology between infection with the WA1 isolate and the delta variant, which were readily corroborated through computed tomography scans. The 64Cu-CR3022-probe also demonstrated dynamic changes occurring between 1- and 2-weeks post-infection. Remarkably, a robust signal was seen in the male genital tract (MGT) of all three animals studied. Infection of the MGT was validated by immunofluorescence imaging of infected cells in the testicular and penile tissue and severe pathology was observed in the testes of one animal at 2-weeks post-infection. The results presented here underscore the utility of using immunoPET to study the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection to understand its pathogenicity and discover new anatomical sites of viral replication.

In this article, we present a CDSS to distinguish between MIS-C and typhus that includes a scoring system that allows the timely distinction of both pathologies only using clinical and laboratory features typically available within the first six hours of presentation to the Emergency Department (ED). The proposed approach was trained and tested on datasets of 87 typhus patients and 133 MIS-C patients. A comparison was made against five well-known statistical and machine-learning models. A second dataset with 111 MIS-C patients was used to verify the AI-MET effectiveness and robustness. The performance assessment for AI-MET and the five statistical and machine learning models was done by computing Sensitivity, Specificity, Accuracy, and Precision. The AI-MET system scores 100 percent in the five metrics used on the training and testing dataset and 99 percent on the validation dataset.",,2023,secondary,doi:10.1101/2023.06.15.23291453,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2023.06.15.23291453,

Objective: To identify risk factors associated with COVID19 breakthrough infections among vaccinated individuals and to reassess the effectiveness of COVID19 vaccination against severe outcomes using realworld data. Design, Setting, and Participants: We conducted a series of observational retrospective analyses using the electronic health records (EHRs) of Columbia University Irving Medical Center/New York Presbyterian (CUIMC/NYP) up to September 21, 2021. New York adult residence with PCR test records were included in this analysis. Main Outcomes and Measures: Poisson regression was used to assess the association between breakthrough infection rate in vaccinated individuals and multiple risk factors, including vaccine brand, demographics, and underlying conditions while adjusting for calendar month, prior number of visits and observational days. Logistic regression was used to assess the association between vaccine administration and infection rate by comparing a vaccinated cohort to a historically matched cohort in the pre-vaccinated period. Infection incident rate was also compared between vaccinated individuals and longitudinally matched unvaccinated individuals. Cox regression was used to estimate the association of the vaccine and COVID19 associated severe outcomes by comparing breakthrough cohort and two matched unvaccinated infection cohorts. Results: Individuals vaccinated with Pfizer/BNT162b2 (IRR against Moderna/mRNA1273 [95% CI]: 1.66 [1.17 - 2.35]); were male (1.47 [1.11 - 1.94%]); and had compromised immune systems (1.48 [1.09 - 2.00]) were at the highest risk for breakthrough infections. Vaccinated individuals had a significant lower infection rate among all subgroups. An increased incidence rate was found in both vaccines over the time. Among individuals infected with COVID19, vaccination significantly reduced the risk of death (adj. HR: 0.20 [0.08 - 0.49]). Conclusion and Relevance: While we found both mRNA vaccines were effective, Moderna/mRNA1273 had a lower incidence rate of breakthrough infections. Both vaccines had increased incidence rates over the time. Immunocompromised individuals were among the highest risk groups experiencing breakthrough infections. Given the rapidly changing nature of the SARSCoV2, continued monitoring and a generalizable analysis pipeline are warranted to inform quick updates on vaccine effectiveness in real time.",medRxiv,2021,secondary,doi:10.1101/2021.10.05.21264583,34642696,8509087,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2021.10.05.21264583,

Epidemics of HAdV infections occur globally, in communities, and in closed or crowded settings. In our institution, a cluster of infants and children admitted for HAdV infection was recently observed. The aim of this study was to describe the pattern of their presenting features and investigate the possible correlation between the HAdV copy number and the clinical picture. Two main patterns of clinical presentation were observed: 68 patients had mainly respiratory symptoms (pharyngitis n = 67, cough n = 44; tonsillar exudate n = 17; other respiratory signs n = 4) while 26 patients showed prevalent gastrointestinal involvement (diarrhea n = 26, vomiting n = 8). Patients with respiratory symptoms had a significantly higher count of WBC, PMN, and platelets, while CRP level approached statistical significance (p = 0.07) for higher values in the patients with diarrhea. In order to explore the impact of selected presenting features, the possible association between the level of CRP and the presence of pharyngeal exudate, cough, vomiting, diarrhea, duration of fever, number of neutrophils, and administration of antibiotics was analyzed. Patients falling in the tertile with more elevated CRP values had tonsillar exudate and diarrhea significantly more often, while those in the lower tertile had a 4.4-day duration fever vs. ≥5.0 days in the remaining patients. Antibiotic therapy was administered more frequently to patients with higher values of CRP (p = 0.006). The duration of hospitalization was not associated with the CRP level. The median time from the receipt of a positive HAdV PCR test result to patient discharge was 1 day in 73% of cases. The number of copies of HAdV detected via PCR ranged between 47 million and 15/μL. Falling in the highest tertile of copy number was significantly associated with pharyngitis. The 24 patients with evidence of viral coinfection had no difference in the demographics or presenting features, with the only exception being a significantly higher leukocyte count. The rapid turn-around of the results of the molecular testing of the HAdV genome on a pharyngeal swab allowed us to rapidly diagnose HAdV infection, allowing us to stop antibiotic therapy and immediately discharge the patients, with reduced discomfort for the families and more appropriate use of hospital beds. A high copy number of HAdV from a pharyngeal swab should not be taken as an indicator of worse prognosis, thus allowing for the preferential use of qualitative rather than quantitative assay.",Children,2023,secondary,doi:10.3390/children10111788,38002879,10670188,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/children10111788,

doi:10.1021/acs.analchem.3c04394,Data-Driven Approach to Modeling Microfabricated Chemical Sensor Manufacturing.,"We have developed a statistical model-based approach to the quality analysis (QA) and quality control (QC) of a gas micro pre-concentrator chip (μPC) performance when manufactured at scale for chemical and biochemical analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). To test the proposed model, a medium-sized university-led production batch of 30 wafers of chips were subjected to rigorous chemical performance testing. We quantitatively report the outcomes of each manufacturing process step leading to the final functional chemical sensor chip. We implemented a principal component analysis (PCA) model to score individual chip chemical performance, and we observed that the first two principal components represent 74.28% of chemical testing variance with 111 of 118 viable chips falling into the 95% confidence interval. Chemical performance scores and chip manufacturing data were analyzed using a multivariate regression model to determine the most influential manufacturing parameters and steps. In our analysis, we find the amount of sorbent mass present in the chip (variable importance score = 2.6) and heater and the RTD resistance values (variable importance score = 1.1) to be the manufacturing parameters with the greatest impact on chemical performance. Other non-obvious latent manufacturing parameters also had quantified influence. Statistical distributions for each manufacturing step will allow future large-scale production runs to be statistically sampled during production to perform QA/QC in a real-time environment.

doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0284483,Wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 genomic populations on a country-wide scale through targeted sequencing,"SARS-CoV-2 surveillance of viral populations in wastewater samples is recognized as a useful tool for monitoring epidemic waves and boosting health preparedness. Next generation sequencing of viral RNA isolated from wastewater is a convenient and cost-effective strategy to understand the molecular epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 and provide insights on the population dynamics of viral variants at the community level. However, in low- and middle-income countries, isolated groups have performed wastewater monitoring and data has not been extensively shared in the scientific community. Here we report the results of monitoring the co-circulation and abundance of variants of concern (VOCs) of SARS-CoV-2 in Uruguay, a small country in Latin America, between November 2020—July 2021 using wastewater surveillance. RNA isolated from wastewater was characterized by targeted sequencing of the Receptor Binding Domain region within the spike gene. Two computational approaches were used to track the viral variants. The results of the wastewater analysis showed the transition in the overall predominance of viral variants in wastewater from No-VOCs to successive VOCs, in agreement with clinical surveillance from sequencing of nasal swabs. The mutations K417T, E484K and N501Y, that characterize the Gamma VOC, were detected as early as December 2020, several weeks before the first clinical case was reported. Interestingly, a non-synonymous mutation described in the Delta VOC, L452R, was detected at a very low frequency since April 2021 when using a recently described sequence analysis tool (SAM Refiner). Wastewater NGS-based surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 is a reliable and complementary tool for monitoring the introduction and prevalence of VOCs at a community level allowing early public health decisions. This approach allows the tracking of symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, who are generally under-reported in countries with limited clinical testing capacity. Our results suggests that wastewater-based epidemiology can contribute to improving public health responses in low- and middle-income countries.",PLOS ONE,2023,secondary,doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0284483,37083889,10121012,https://doi.org/doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0284483,

However, when growing fresh produce, this practice increases the risk of bacterial contamination. Thus, rapid and accurate identification of pathogenic organisms such as Shiga-toxin producing Escherichia coli (STEC) is crucial for resource management when using alternative water(s). Although many biosensors exist for monitoring pathogens in food systems, there is an urgent need for data analysis methodologies that can be applied to accurately predict bacteria concentrations in complex matrices such as untreated surface water. In this work, we applied an impedimetric electrochemical aptasensor based on gold interdigitated electrodes for measuring E. coliO157:H7 in surface water for hydroponic lettuce irrigation. We developed a statistical machine-learning (SML) framework for assessing different existing SML methods to predict the E. coliO157:H7 concentration. In this study, three classes of statistical models were evaluated for optimizing prediction accuracy. The SML framework developed here facilitates selection of the most appropriate analytical approach for a given application. In the case of E. coliO157:H7 prediction in untreated surface water, selection of the optimum SML technique led to a reduction of test set RMSE by at least 20% when compared with the classic analytical technique. The statistical framework and code (open source) include a portfolio of SML models, an approach which can be used by other researchers using electrochemical biosensors to measure pathogens in hydroponic irrigation water for rapid decision support.",ACS Omega,2023,secondary,doi:10.1021/acsomega.3c05797,37744804,10515366,https://doi.org/doi:10.1021/acsomega.3c05797,

A non-invasive and unbiased method is needed to clarify whole body spatiotemporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection after transmission. We recently developed a probe based on the anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody CR3022 to study SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in vivo. Herein, we describe its use in immunoPET to investigate SARS-CoV-2 infection of three rhesus macaques. Using PET/CT imaging of macaques at different times post-SARS-CoV-2 inoculation, we track the 64Cu-labelled CR3022-F(ab’)2 probe targeting the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 to study the dynamics of infection within the respiratory tract and uncover novel sites of infection. Using this method, we uncovered differences in lung pathology between infection with the WA1 isolate and the delta variant, which were readily corroborated through computed tomography scans. The 64Cu-CR3022-probe also demonstrated dynamic changes occurring between 1- and 2-weeks post-infection. Remarkably, a robust signal was seen in the male genital tract (MGT) of all three animals studied. Infection of the MGT was validated by immunofluorescence imaging of infected cells in the testicular and penile tissue and severe pathology was observed in the testes of one animal at 2-weeks post-infection. The results presented here underscore the utility of using immunoPET to study the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection to understand its pathogenicity and discover new anatomical sites of viral replication. We provide direct evidence for SARS-CoV-2 infection of the MGT in rhesus macaques revealing the possible pathologic outcomes of viral replication at these sites.

doi:10.1101/2022.06.21.22276659,Pre-Omicron vaccine breakthrough infection induces superior cross-neutralization against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1 than primo infection,"SARS-CoV-2 variants raise concern because of their high transmissibility and their ability to evade neutralizing antibodies elicited by prior infection or by vaccination. Here we compared the ability of sera from 70 unvaccinated COVID-19 patients infected before the emergence of variants of concern (VOCs) and from 16 vaccine breakthrough infection (BTI) cases infected with Gamma or Delta to neutralize the ancestral B.1 strain, and the Gamma, Delta and Omicron BA.1 variants using live virus. We further determined antibody levels against the Spike protein, the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) and the N-terminal domain (NTD) of Spike. Convalescent sera featured considerable variability in neutralization of B.1 and in cross-neutralization of different strains, and neutralizing capacity moderately correlated with antibody levels against Spike and the RBD. All but one convalescent serum failed to neutralize Omicron BA.1. Overall, convalescent sera from patients with moderate disease had higher antibody levels and displayed higher neutralizing ability against all strains than patients with mild or severe forms of disease. Sera from BTI cases fell into one of two categories: half the sera had high neutralizing activity against the ancestral B.1 strain as well as against the infecting strain, while the other half had no or very low neutralizing activity against all strains. Although antibody levels against Spike and the RBD were lower in BTI cases than in unvaccinated convalescent sera, most neutralizing sera also retained partial neutralizing activity against Omicron BA.1, indicative of cross-neutralization between B.1, Delta and Omicron and suggestive of higher affinity, as confirmed by the IC50:Ab level ratios. Neutralizing activity of BTI sera was strongly correlated with antibodies against Spike and the RBD.

doi:10.1021/acs.chemrev.3c00377,Aptamer-Protein Interactions: From Regulation to Biomolecular Detection.,"Serving as the basis of cell life, interactions between nucleic acids and proteins play essential roles in fundamental cellular processes. Aptamers are unique single-stranded oligonucleotides generated by in vitro evolution methods, possessing the ability to interact with proteins specifically. Altering the structure of aptamers will largely modulate their interactions with proteins and further affect related cellular behaviors. Recently, with the in-depth research of aptamer-protein interactions, the analytical assays based on their interactions have been widely developed and become a powerful tool for biomolecular detection. There are some insightful reviews on aptamers applied in protein detection, while few systematic discussions are from the perspective of regulating aptamer-protein interactions. Herein, we comprehensively introduce the methods for regulating aptamer-protein interactions and elaborate on the detection techniques for analyzing aptamer-protein interactions. Additionally, this review provides a broad summary of analytical assays based on the regulation of aptamer-protein interactions for detecting biomolecules. Finally, we present our perspectives regarding the opportunities and challenges of analytical assays for biological analysis, aiming to provide guidance for disease mechanism research and drug discovery.",Chemical reviews,2023,secondary,doi:10.1021/acs.chemrev.3c00377,37931070,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1021/acs.chemrev.3c00377,

The susceptibility of immunity to viral evolution is shaped in part by the breadth of epitopes targeted. Here we compare the specificity of antibodies elicited by the mRNA-1273 vaccine versus natural infection. The neutralizing activity of vaccine-elicited antibodies is even more focused on the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) than for infection-elicited antibodies. However, within the RBD, binding of vaccine-elicited antibodies is more broadly distributed across epitopes than for infection-elicited antibodies. This greater binding breadth means single RBD mutations have less impact on neutralization by vaccine sera than convalescent sera. Therefore, antibody immunity acquired by different means may have differing susceptibility to erosion by viral evolution. One Sentence Summary Deep mutational scanning shows the mRNA-1273 RBD-binding antibody response is less affected by single viral mutations than the infection response.",bioRxiv,2021,secondary,doi:10.1101/2021.04.14.439844,33880474,8057239,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2021.04.14.439844,
doi:10.1515/revac-2022-0051,RNA-based isothermal amplification technology and its clinical application in pathogen infection,"Abstract It is very important to detect pathogenic bacteria, viruses, or fungi in a patient’s secretion or body fluid samples as soon as possible to determine the patient’s recovery. For certain pathogens, the amount of ribosomal RNA copies contained is often tens of thousands of times higher than the amount of DNA copies, so the detection of RNA has higher sensitivity. In addition, whether for DNA pathogens or RNA pathogens, the direct detection of ribonucleic acid transcribed by pathogens in vivo can distinguish active infection or past infection, can eliminate the influence of residual DNA of pathogens that have died in the lesions, and can also avoid excessive medical interventions for transient infections, which is of great significance in the field of infectious pathogen detection. Isothermal amplification technology played important roles in molecular diagnosis because of its significant advantages. Highly sensitive RNA detection can be achieved by both direct transcription amplification and indirect amplification based on reverse transcription. Direct transcription amplification technologies relies on reverse transcriptase and T7 RNA polymerase to achieve linear transcription amplification of RNA on one-step; while the indirect amplification technology depends on a reverse transcriptional process at the beginning of the reaction. Both methods have outstanding advantages in clinical application, and commercial kits and commercial all-in-one machines based on these principles have been put into clinical use. This review mainly introduces the clinical application of isothermal amplification technologies in the detection of RNA pathogens and the main difficulties faced at this stage. It is hoped to provide insightful ideas for the construction of pathogen RNA detection technology to meet the needs of point-of-care testing in the future.",Reviews in Analytical Chemistry,2022,secondary,doi:10.1515/revac-2022-0051,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1515/revac-2022-0051,

Methods: Anti-receptor binding domain, anti-spike S2, and anti-nucleocapsid immunoglobin-G (IgG) and immunoglobin-A levels were measured in 139 pediatric patients with IBD [65 fully vaccinated (2 doses), median age 16.3, interquartile range (IQR) 15.2–17.8 years, median time from vaccination (IQR) 61.0 (42.0–80.0) days] and 1744 controls (46, 37–57 years) using microblot array. Results: All IBD and control patients developed positive anti-receptor binding domain IgG antibodies at comparable titers. The proportion of observations with positive anti-spike S2 IgG was higher in patients with IBD than in controls [63% vs 21%, odds ratio 2.99 (1.51–5.90)], as was its titer [median (IQR) 485 (92–922) vs 79 [33–180] IU/mL]. Anti-receptor binding domain and anti-spike S2 IgG levels were associated with IBD status. We found an association between anti-spike S2 IgG levels and time since vaccination (β −4.85, 95% CI −7.14 to 2.71, P = 0.0001), history of SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction positivity (206.76, 95% CI 39.93–374.05, P = 0.0213), and anti-tumor necrosis factor treatment (−239.68, 95% CI −396.44–83.55, P = 0.0047). Forty-three percent of patients reported vaccination side effects (mostly mild). Forty-six percent of observations with positive anti-nucleocapsid IgG had a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusions: Patients with IBD produced higher levels of postvaccination anti-spike S2 antibodies than controls.

However, reliable analytical methods and appropriate approaches for the normalization of results are important requirements for implementing state-wide monitoring programs. In times of insufficient case reporting, the evaluation of wastewater data is challenging. Between December 2021 and July 2022, we analyzed 646 samples from 23 WWTPs in Thuringia, Germany. We investigated the performance of a direct capture-based method for RNA extraction (4S-method) and evaluated four normalization methods (NH4-N, COD, Ntot, and PMMoV) in a pooled analysis using different epidemiological metrics. The performance requirements of the 4S method were well met. The method could be successfully applied to implement a state-wide wastewater monitoring program including a large number of medium and small wastewater treatment plants (<100,000 p.e) in high spatial density. Correlations between wastewater data and 7-day incidence or 7-day-hospitalization incidence were strong and independent from the normalization method. For the test positivity rate, PMMoV-normalized data showed a better correlation than data normalized with chemical markers. In times of low testing frequency and insufficient case reporting, 7-day-incidence data might become less reliable. Alternative epidemiological metrics like hospital admissions and test positivity data are increasingly important for evaluating wastewater monitoring data and normalization methods.

Nevertheless, the assembling process is still limited by the slow diffusion dynamics of NPs and the low concentration of analytes in trace detections, which hinders further improvement of the sensitivity and repeatability of the sensors. In this work, by functionalizing the gold NPs with specific ligands, we constructed a dual-mode optical sensing platform for multianalytes based on the plasmonic NP array at the liquid-liquid interface. Through emulsification, the NP diffusion kinetics are boosted for several orders, and the NPs are condensed from the bulk aqueous phase to the liquid-liquid interface as a plasmonic array. The as-formed metasurface generates major reflectance and surface-enhanced Raman scattering changes in response to analytes, providing two optical sensing modes.

Methods This phase 3 COVID-19 prevention trial (NCT04452318) with casirivimab and imdevimab was conducted in July 2020–February 2021, before widespread vaccine availability. Placebo-treated participants who were uninfected (SARS-CoV-2 quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction [RT-qPCR] negative) and seronegative were assessed weekly for 28 days (efficacy assessment period [EAP]) for COVID-19 symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-qPCR of nasopharyngeal swab samples and for serostatus by antinucleocapsid immunoglobulin (Ig) G. Regression-based modeling, including causal mediation analysis, estimated the effects of viral load on seroconversion. Results Of 157/1069 (14.7%) uninfected and seronegative (for antispike IgG, antispike IgA, and antinucleocapsid IgG) participants who became infected during the EAP, 105 (65%) seroconverted. The mean (SD) maximum viral load of seroconverters was 7.23 (1.68) log10 copies/mL vs 4.8 (2.2) log10 copies/mL in those who remained seronegative; viral loads of ∼6.0 log10 copies/mL better predicted seroconversion. The mean of the maximum viral load was 7.11 log10 copies/mL in symptomatic participants vs 5.58 log10 copies/mL in asymptomatic participants. The mean duration of detectable viral load was longer in seroconverted vs seronegative participants: 3.24 vs 1.63 weeks. Conclusions Maximum SARS-CoV-2 viral load is a major driver of seroconversion and symptomatic COVID-19, with high viral loads (∼6.0 log10 copies/mL) better predicting seroconversion.

However, the integrity and accuracy of most genomic information cannot be guaranteed due to limited sample quality and sequencing technology. This restricts researchers from tracking the latest changes in the virus genome. In this study, we aimed to characterize the diversity and conservation balance of complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes worldwide since the outbreak. To achieve this goal, we collected 5,966,490 genome sequences from various parts of the world, excluding those with incomplete or unknown/degenerate sequences. Our methodology included comparing sequences using BLASTN and BLASTP, analyzing RNA secondary structure, and calculating entropy. Our findings provide insights into the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and potential mechanisms of pathogenesis. We found that uracil had the highest proportion of all bases among various coronaviruses and cytosine to uracil mutations had the highest proportion among all point mutations. The consistency in the front part (1–26,599 nt) was significantly higher than that in the back part (26,600–29,903 nt) of the genome. For most genes, the similar consistency characteristics were also observed in their protein families. IMPORTANCE Our results indicate that most severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 genomes sampled from patients had a mutation rate ≤1.07 ‰ and genome-tail proteins (including S protein) were the main sources of genetic polymorphism.

Herein, we determined the crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 (S84) (one of the epidemic isoforms) and the bat coronavirus RaTG13 ORF8 variant at 1.62 Å and 1.76 Å resolution, respectively. Comparison of these ORF8 proteins demonstrates that the 62-77 residues in Ig-like domain of coronavirus ORF8 adopt different conformations. Combined with mutagenesis assays, the residue Cys20 of ORF8 is responsible for forming the covalent disulfide-linked dimer in crystal packing and in vitro biochemical conditions. Furthermore, immune cell-binding assays indicate that various ORF8 (SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 (L84), ORF8 (S84), and RaTG13 ORF8) proteins have different interaction capabilities with human CD14+ monocytes in human peripheral blood.

doi:10.1002/alr.23314,Stellate ganglion block for treating post-COVID-19 parosmia.,"BACKGROUND
Post-COVID parosmia may be due to dysautonomia and sympathetic hyperresponsiveness, which can be attenuated by stellate ganglion block (SGB). This study evaluates SGB as a treatment for post-COVID olfactory dysfunction (OD).


METHODS
Retrospective case series with prospective data of patients with post-COVID OD undergoing unilateral (UL) or bilateral (BL) SGB. Patients completed Brief Smell Identification Tests (BSIT) (12 points maximum) and post-procedure surveys including parosmia severity scores on a scale of 1 (absent) to 10 (severe). Scores were compared from before treatment (pre-SGB) to after first (SGB1) or second (SGB2) treatments in overall, UL, and BL cohorts.


RESULTS
Forty-seven patients with post-COVID OD underwent SGB, including 23 UL and 24 BL. Twenty patients completed pre- and post-SGB BSITs (eight UL and 12 BL). Twenty-eight patients completed postprocedure surveys (11 UL and 17 BL). There were no differences in BSIT scores from pre-SGB to post-SGB1 or post-SGB2 for the overall (p = 0.098), UL (p = 0.168), or BL (p = 0.230) cohorts. Parosmia severity for the overall cohort improved from pre-SGB (8.82 ± 1.28) to post-SGB1 (6.79 ± 2.38) and post-SGB2 (5.41 ± 2.35), with significant differences from pre-SGB to post-SGB1 (p < 0.001) and pre-SGB to post-SGB2 (p < 0.001), but not post-SGB1 to post-SGB2 (p = 0.130). Number of parosmia triggers decreased for overall (p = 0.002), UL (p = 0.030) and BL (p = 0.024) cohorts. Quality of life (QOL) improved for all cohorts regarding food enjoyment, meal preparation, and socialization (p < 0.05).

The prevalence of the variants identified from the wastewater sequencing data showed that the Omicron variant BA.1 had spread in Davos and St. Moritz during the international sporting events hosted there in December 2021. This spread was associated with an increase in case numbers, while it was not observed in Landquart and Lostallo. Another instance of new variant spread occurred during the WEF in January 2023, when the Omicron variant BA.2.75 arrived in Davos but not in St. Moritz.

With the recent explosion in knowledge about the role of the gut microbiome in health and disease, there is certainly compelling evidence for the primary role of ‘the gut’ in human health. One of the most challenging modern diseases is obesity. The alarming increase in rates of obesity, diabetes and other metabolic diseases over the past few decades is exerting a huge burden on the healthcare systems and economies across the globe. This burden includes patients with gastrointestinal and liver diseases who present primarily because of those manifestations, rather than the obesity itself. This article documents at least 10 principal reasons why gastroenterologists should be treating obesity in patients presenting with gastrointestinal diseases (box 1). Essentially, treating obesity is relevant to health in general as well as impacting the gastrointestinal disease itself. Our aim for this article is to stimulate discussion within our specialty and within the wider medical society. In addition to diet and lifestyle interventions that are well established as being relevant to management of obesity, the last decade has documented therapeutic advances. These advances include the greater efficacy of pharmacological approaches based on single or dual incretin analogues or agonists compared with other medications approved for treatment of obesity, in addition to endoscopic or surgical bariatric procedures.

doi:10.3389/fcimb.2023.1161445,Evaluating the effect of SARS-CoV-2 spike mutations with a linear doubly robust learner,"Driven by various mutations on the viral Spike protein, diverse variants of SARS-CoV-2 have emerged and prevailed repeatedly, significantly prolonging the pandemic. This phenomenon necessitates the identification of key Spike mutations for fitness enhancement. To address the need, this manuscript formulates a well-defined framework of causal inference methods for evaluating and identifying key Spike mutations to the viral fitness of SARS-CoV-2. In the context of large-scale genomes of SARS-CoV-2, it estimates the statistical contribution of mutations to viral fitness across lineages and therefore identifies important mutations. Further, identified key mutations are validated by computational methods to possess functional effects, including Spike stability, receptor-binding affinity, and potential for immune escape. Based on the effect score of each mutation, individual key fitness-enhancing mutations such as D614G and T478K are identified and studied. From individual mutations to protein domains, this paper recognizes key protein regions on the Spike protein, including the receptor-binding domain and the N-terminal domain. This research even makes further efforts to investigate viral fitness via mutational effect scores, allowing us to compute the fitness score of different SARS-CoV-2 strains and predict their transmission capacity based solely on their viral sequence. This prediction of viral fitness has been validated using BA.2.12.1, which is not used for regression training but well fits the prediction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research to apply causal inference models to mutational analysis on large-scale genomes of SARS-CoV-2.

doi:10.1002/jcp.30948,Potential roles of NLRP3 inflammasome in the pathogenesis of Kawasaki disease,"There is a heterogeneous group of rare illnesses that fall into the vasculitis category and are characterized mostly by blood vessel inflammation. Ischemia and disrupted blood flow will cause harm to the organs whose blood arteries become inflamed. Kawasaki disease (KD) is the most prevalent kind of vasculitis in children aged 5 years or younger. Because KD's cardiovascular problems might persist into adulthood, it is no longer thought of as a self‐limiting disease. KD is a systemic vasculitis with unknown initiating factors. Numerous factors, such as genetic predisposition and infectious pathogens, are implicated in the etiology of KD. As endothelial cell damage and inflammation can lead to coronary endothelial dysfunction in KD, some studies hypothesized the crucial role of pyroptosis in the pathogenesis of KD. Additionally, pyroptosis‐related proteins like caspase‐1, apoptosis‐associated speck‐like protein containing a CARD (ASC), proinflammatory cytokines like IL‐1 and IL‐18, lactic dehydrogenase, and Gasdermin D (GSDMD) have been found to be overexpressed in KD patients when compared to healthy controls. These occurrences may point to an involvement of inflammasomes and pyroptotic cell death in the etiology of KD and suggest potential treatment targets. Based on these shreds of evidence, in this review, we aim to focus on one of the well‐defined inflammasomes, NLRP3, and its role in the pathophysiology of KD.",Journal of Cellular Physiology,2023,secondary,doi:10.1002/jcp.30948,36649375,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1002/jcp.30948,

Techniques adopted for this purpose must be robust, accurate, rapid, and sufficiently agile to respond to new and emerging threats. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), especially real-time PCR, remains an essential diagnostic tool but it is now being complemented by high-throughput sequencing using both Oxford Nanopore and Illumina technologies, allowing unbiased screening of whole populations. The demand for and value of Point-of-Use (PoU) technologies, which allow for in situ screening, are also increasing. Isothermal PoU molecular diagnostics based on recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) and loop-mediated amplification (LAMP) do not require expensive equipment and can reach PCR-comparable levels of sensitivity.

doi:10.3389/fimmu.2021.793197,SARS-CoV-2-Specific T Cell Responses Are Stronger in Children With Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome Compared to Children With Uncomplicated SARS-CoV-2 Infection,"Background Despite similar rates of infection, adults and children have markedly different morbidity and mortality related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Compared to adults, children have infrequent severe manifestations of acute infection but are uniquely at risk for the rare and often severe Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) following infection. We hypothesized that these differences in presentation are related to differences in the magnitude and/or antigen specificity of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell (CST) responses between adults and children. We therefore set out to measure the CST response in convalescent adults versus children with and without MIS-C following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods CSTs were expanded from blood collected from convalescent children and adults post SARS-CoV-2 infection and evaluated by intracellular flow cytometry, surface markers, and cytokine production following stimulation with SARS-CoV-2-specific peptides. Presence of serum/plasma antibody to spike and nucleocapsid was measured using the luciferase immunoprecipitation systems (LIPS) assay. Findings Twenty-six of 27 MIS-C patients, 7 of 8 non-MIS-C convalescent children, and 13 of 14 adults were seropositive for spike and nucleocapsid antibody. CST responses in MIS-C patients were significantly higher than children with uncomplicated SARS-CoV-2 infection, but weaker than CST responses in convalescent adults. Interpretation Age-related differences in the magnitude of CST responses suggest differing post-infectious immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in children compared to adults post uncomplicated infection. Children with MIS-C have CST responses that are stronger than children with uncomplicated SARS-CoV-2 infection and weaker than convalescent adults, despite near uniform seropositivity.",Frontiers in Immunology,2022,secondary,doi:10.3389/fimmu.2021.793197,35116027,8803660,https://doi.org/doi:10.3389/fimmu.2021.793197,

SARS-CoV-2 infection was shown to suppress global mRNA splicing, and at least 10 SARS-CoV-2 proteins bind specifically to one or more human RNAs. Here, we investigate 17 published experimental and clinical datasets related to SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as datasets from the betacoronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS as well as Streptococcus pneumonia, HCV, Zika virus, Dengue virus, influenza H3N2, and RSV. We show that genes showing differential alternative splicing in SARS-CoV-2 have a similar functional profile to those of SARS-CoV and MERS and affect a diverse set of genes and biological functions, including many closely related to virus biology. Additionally, the differentially spliced transcripts of cells infected by coronaviruses were more likely to undergo intron-retention, contain a pseudouridine modification and a smaller number of exons than differentially spliced transcripts in the control groups. Viral load in clinical COVID-19 samples was correlated with isoform distribution of differentially spliced genes. A significantly higher number of ribosomal genes are affected by DAS and DGE in betacoronavirus samples, and the betacoronavirus differentially spliced genes are depleted for binding sites of RNA-binding proteins.

A large portion of these bacteria can potentially threaten human health. ABSTRACT Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) seriously threatens public health by reducing antibiotic effectiveness in curing bacterial infections. Atmospheric particulate matter (APM) is a common environmental hazard that affects human health by causing various diseases and disseminating bacterial pathogenesis, of which pathogenic bacteria and AMR are essential parts. The properties of APM microbiomes and resistomes, along with their shaping factors and mutual relationships, need further examination. To address this, we analyzed APMs collected from 13 cities within four clusters (North and South China, Inner Mongolia, and Tibet). Significant regionalization was found for both the microbiomes (P < 0.001) and core resistomes (P < 0.001) for APMs, with statistical analyses showing significant differences in different regions. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and accompanying ANOSIM analyses showed that microbiomes and core resistomes followed the same regional subclustering hierarchy patterns. This finding, together with response analysis of APM microbiomes and core resistomes to environmental parameters that showed similar response patterns, as well as Procrustes analysis (M2 = 0.963, P < 0.05) between APM microbiomes and core resistomes, strongly suggested that APM microbiomes and core resistomes are correlated. Co-occurrence network analysis further revealed key taxa and antimicrobial resistance determinants in the interactions between APM microbiomes and core resistomes. Thus, it was concluded that APM microbiome and resistome compositions were highly regional, that environmental pollutants and APM levels impacted APM microbiomes and resistomes, and that microbiomes and resistomes in APMs are significantly correlated (P < 0.05). IMPORTANCE Bacteria associated with atmospheric particulate matter (APMs) can transmit over long distances. A large portion of these bacteria can potentially threaten human health. The antimicrobial resistance (AMR) of pathogenic bacteria carried by APMs prevents curing from infections. Therefore, both the pathogenic bacteria in APMs and their AMR are receiving more attention. The literature suggests a knowledge gap that exists for bacterial AMR and bacterial pathogenesis in APMs, including their distribution patterns, mutual relationships, and factors influencing their compositions. This work aimed to bridge this knowledge gap by studying APM samples collected from 13 cities. The results demonstrated that both bacteria and antibiotic resistance determinants were highly regional and that their composition patterns were significantly correlated, and influenced by the same group of environmental factors. This study thus determined the relationship between the two important aspects of bacterial pathogenesis in APMs and represents significant progress in understanding bacterial pathogenesis in APMs.",mSystems,2022,secondary,doi:10.1128/msystems.00698-22,36154139,9600985,https://doi.org/doi:10.1128/msystems.00698-22,

However, vaccine breakthrough infections have been widely observed, raising the question of whether particular viral variants or viral mutations are associated with breakthrough. ABSTRACT The severe acute respiratory coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of the global outbreak of COVID-19. Evidence suggests that the virus is evolving to allow efficient spread through the human population, including vaccinated individuals. Here, we report a study of viral variants from surveillance of the Delaware Valley, including the city of Philadelphia, and variants infecting vaccinated subjects. We sequenced and analyzed complete viral genomes from 2621 surveillance samples from March 2020 to September 2021 and compared them to genome sequences from 159 vaccine breakthroughs. In the early spring of 2020, all detected variants were of the B.1 and closely related lineages. A mixture of lineages followed, notably including B.1.243 followed by B.1.1.7 (alpha), with other lineages present at lower levels. Later isolations were dominated by B.1.617.2 (delta) and other delta lineages; delta was the exclusive variant present by the last time sampled. To investigate whether any variants appeared preferentially in vaccine breakthroughs, we devised a model based on Bayesian autoregressive moving average logistic multinomial regression to allow rigorous comparison. This revealed that B.1.617.2 (delta) showed 3-fold enrichment in vaccine breakthrough cases (odds ratio of 3; 95% credible interval 0.89-11). Viral point substitutions could also be associated with vaccine breakthroughs, notably the N501Y substitution found in the alpha, beta and gamma variants (odds ratio 2.04; 95% credible interval of1.25–3.18). This study thus overviews viral evolution and vaccine breakthroughs in the Delaware Valley and introduces a rigorous statistical approach to interrogating enrichment of breakthrough variants against a changing background. IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is highly effective at reducing viral infection, hospitalization and death. However, vaccine breakthrough infections have been widely observed, raising the question of whether particular viral variants or viral mutations are associated with breakthrough. Here, we report analysis of 2621 surveillance isolates from people diagnosed with COVID-19 in the Delaware Valley in southeastern Pennsylvania, allowing rigorous comparison to 159 vaccine breakthrough case specimens. Our best estimate is a 3-fold enrichment for some lineages of delta among breakthroughs, and enrichment of a notable spike substitution, N501Y. We introduce statistical methods that should be widely useful for evaluating vaccine breakthroughs and other viral phenotypes.",mBio,2022,secondary,doi:10.1128/mbio.03788-21,35130727,8942461,https://doi.org/doi:10.1128/mbio.03788-21,

Transition from the pandemic to the endemic phase prioritized alternative testing strategies to maintain effective epidemic surveillance at the population level, with less intensive sequencing efforts. One such promising approach was Wastewater-Based Surveillance (WBS), which offers non-invasive, cost-effective means for analysing virus trends at the sewershed level. From 2020 onwards, wastewater has been recognized as an instrumental source of information for public health, with national and international authorities exploring options to implement national wastewater surveillance systems and increasingly relying on WBS as early warning of potential pathogen outbreaks. In Portugal, several pioneer projects joined the academia, water utilities and Public Administration around WBS. To validate WBS as an effective genomic surveillance strategy, it is crucial to collect long term performance data. In this work, we present one year of systematic SARS-CoV-2 wastewater surveillance in Portugal, representing 35% of the mainland population. We employed two complementary methods for lineage determination - allelic discrimination by RT-PCR and S gene sequencing. This combination allowed us to monitor variant evolution in near-real-time and identify low-frequency mutations. Over the course of this year-long study, spanning from May 2022 to April 2023, we successfully tracked the dominant Omicron sub-lineages, their progression and evolution, which aligned with concurrent clinical surveillance data. Our results underscore the effectiveness of WBS as a tracking system for virus variants, with the ability to unveil mutations undetected via massive sequencing of clinical samples from Portugal, demonstrating the ability of WBS to uncover new mutations and detect rare genetic variants. Our findings emphasize that knowledge of the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 at the population level can be extended far beyond via the combination of routine clinical genomic surveillance with wastewater sequencing and genotyping.",,2023,secondary,doi:10.1101/2023.10.30.23297774,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2023.10.30.23297774,

Model organisms can be unreliable in the field, but selecting an isolate from the thousands that naturally live there and genetically manipulating them to carry the desired function is a slow and uninformed process. Here, we demonstrate the parallel engineering of isolates from environmental samples by using the broad-host-range XPORT conjugation system (Bacillus subtilis mini-ICEBs1) to transfer a genetic payload to many isolates in parallel. Bacillus and Lysinibacillus species were obtained from seven soil and water samples from different locations in Israel. XPORT successfully transferred a genetic function (reporter expression) into 25 of these isolates. They were then screened to identify the best-performing chassis based on the expression level, doubling time, functional stability in soil, and environmentally-relevant traits of its closest annotated reference species, such as the ability to sporulate and temperature tolerance. From this library, we selected Bacillus frigoritolerans A3E1, re-introduced it to soil, and measured function and genetic stability in a contained environment that replicates jungle conditions.

However, few studies examined the impact of university policies on the effectiveness of WBE to identify cases and mitigate transmission. The objective of this study was to retrospectively assess relationships between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) wastewater outcomes and COVID-19 cases in residential buildings of a large university campus across two academic semesters (August 2020–May 2021) under different COVID-19 mitigation policies. Clinical case surveillance data of student residents were obtained from the university COVID-19 response program. We collected and processed building-level wastewater for detection and quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-qPCR. The odds of obtaining a positive wastewater sample increased with COVID-19 clinical cases in the fall semester (OR = 1.50, P value = 0.02), with higher odds in the spring semester (OR = 2.63, P value < 0.0001). We observed linear associations between SARS-CoV-2 wastewater concentrations and COVID-19 clinical cases (parameter estimate = 1.2, P value = 0.006).

The Need for a Multi-Ecosystem Approach to Microbiome Studies,"While the COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased focus on pathogenic microbes that cross the animal-human species barrier, calls to include non-pathogenic interactions in our perspective on public health are gaining traction in the academic community. Over generations, the diversity of the human gut microbiota is being challenged by external perturbations and reduced acquisition of symbiotic species throughout life. When such reduced diversity concerns not only the microbial species, but also the higher taxonomic levels and even the guild level, adequate compensation for possible losses may be lacking. Shifts from a high-abundance to a low-abundance state, known as a tipping point, may result in simultaneous shifts in covarying taxa and ultimately to a catastrophic collapse in which the ecosystem abruptly and possibly irreversibly shifts to an alternative state. Here, we propose that co-occurrence patterns within and between microbial communities across human, animal, soil, water, and other environmental domains should be studied in light of such critical transitions. Improved mechanistic understanding of factors that shape structure and function is needed to understand whether interventions can sustainably remodel disease-prone microbiota compositions to robust and resilient healthy microbiota. Prerequisites for a rational approach are a better understanding of the microbial interaction network, both within and inter-domain, as well as the identification of early warning signs for a catastrophic collapse, warranting a timely response for intervention. We should not forget that mutualism and pathogenicity are two sides of the same coin. Building upon the planetary health concept, we argue that microbiome research should include system level approaches to conserve ecosystem resilience. HIGHLIGHTS 1. Non-pathogenic interactions between ecosystems play a key role in maintaining health. 2. The human gut microbiome may be on the verge of a catastrophic collapse. 3.

Key questions remain regarding effective means of minimizing the impact of VOC, in particular the feasibility of containing them at source, in light of global interconnectedness. By analysing a stochastic transmission model of COVID-19, we identify the appropriate monitoring requirements that make containment at source feasible. Specifically, precise risk assessment informed primarily by epidemiological indicators (e.g. accumulated hospitalization or mortality reports), is unlikely prior to VOC escape. Consequently, decision makers will need to make containment decisions without confident severity estimates. In contrast, successfully identifying and containing variants via genomic surveillance is realistic, provided sequence processing and dissemination is prompt.",PNAS Nexus,2022,secondary,doi:10.1093/pnasnexus/pgac159,36111270,9465520,https://doi.org/doi:10.1093/pnasnexus/pgac159,

Some main predictors of severe clinical course in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection are age and concomitant health conditions. Therefore, the proper evaluation of SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity is urgently required to understand and predict the spectrum of possible clinical phenotypes and recommend vaccination options and regimens in children. Furthermore, it is critical to characterize the nature of SARS-CoV-2-specific immune responses in children following asymptomatic infection and COVID-19 and other related conditions such as multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C), para-infectious and late postinfectious consequences. Recent studies involving children revealed a variety of cytokines, T cells and antibody responses in the pathogenesis of the disease. Moreover, different clinical scenarios in children were observed-asymptomatic seroprevalence, acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, and rarely severe COVID-19 with typical cytokine storm, MIS-C, long COVID-19, etc. Therefore, to gain a better clinical view, adequate diagnostic criteria and treatment algorithms, it is essential to create a realistic picture of the immunological puzzle of SARS-CoV-2 infection in different age groups.

We evaluated at-home testing in Black and Latino communities through an intervention comparing community-based organization (CBO) and health care organization (HCO) outreach. From May through December 2021, 1100 participants were recruited, 94% through CBOs. The odds of COVID-19 test requests and completions were significantly higher in the HCO arm. The results showed disparities in test requests and completions related to age, race, language, insurance, comorbidities, and pandemic-related challenges.

Testing pooled samples could meet this demand; however, the sensitivity of reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), the gold standard, significantly decreases with an increasing number of samples pooled. Here, we introduce detection of intact virus by exogenous-nucleotide reaction (DIVER), a method that quantifies intact virus and is robust to sample dilution. As demonstrated using two models of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, DIVER first tags membraned particles with exogenous oligonucleotides, then captures the tagged particles on beads functionalized with a virus-specific capture agent (in this instance, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), and finally quantifies the oligonucleotide tags using qPCR. Using spike-presenting liposomes and spike-pseudotyped lentivirus, we show that DIVER can detect 1 × 105 liposomes and 100 plaque-forming units of lentivirus and can successfully identify positive samples in pooling experiments. Overall, DIVER is well positioned for efficient sample pooling and clinical validation.",Analytical chemistry,2022,secondary,doi:10.1021/acs.analchem.2c00835,35584293,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1021/acs.analchem.2c00835,

Methods: We describe a child with all 3 of these unusual features. We discuss his clinical presentation, medical management, review of the current literature and CDC guidance recommendations regarding further vaccinations. Results: A 5-year-old boy had onset of MIS-C symptoms 55 days after COVID-19 illness and 15 days after receiving his first BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination. He was admitted 3 times for MIS-C, and twice after his steroid dose was tapered. On his initial admission, he was given intravenous immunoglobulin and steroids. During his second admission, new, moderate coronary dilation was noted, and he was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin and steroids. At his last admission, worsening coronary dilation was noted, and he was treated with infliximab and steroids. During follow-up, he had improvement in his coronary artery dilatation. However, his inflammatory markers increased after steroid wean, and his steroid taper was further extended, after which time his inflammatory markers improved. This is the only such reported case of a patient who was admitted 3 times for MIS-C complications after COVID-19 vaccination. Conclusion: MIS-C rarely involves delayed giant coronary aneurysms, multiple readmissions, or occurrence after COVID-19 vaccination. Whether our patient’s COVID-19 vaccine 6 weeks after COVID-19 illness contributed to his MIS-C is unknown.

Here, we address the variant deconvolution problem, where we aim to estimate the relative abundances of genomic variants from next-generation sequencing data of a mixed wastewater sample. We introduce LolliPop, a computational method to solve the variant deconvolution problem by simultaneously solving least squares problems and kernel-based smoothing of relative variant abundances from wastewater time series sequencing data.

The identification of genetic risks and pharmacogenetic loci, which are involved in determining drug responses, could help enhance early patient diagnosis, assist in risk stratification of patients, and reveal novel targets for pharmacological interventions, including possibilities for drug repositioning. Here, we highlight the basis and importance of the most common genetic approaches to understanding the pathogenesis of ARDS and its critical triggers.

doi:10.1515/cclm-2022-0392,The never-ending quest for antibody assays standardization and appropriate measurement units,"In this issue of the Journal, Hansen et al. are reporting an interesting observation on the proposed WHO standard for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies [1]. In their opinion, introducing separate units for results obtained using neutralising antibody (Nab) assays and for results from binding antibody (bAb) assays is not appropriate as it represents ‘a deviation from international nomenclature conventions used by WHO to assign International Units to CRM’. In addition, the authors bring on a proposal to use a common term for international units (IU) while maintaining a distinction according to the target antibodies of different assays, e.g., neutralizing antibodies targeting specific portions of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, binding antibodies to spike or binding antibodies to the nucleocapsid. We recognize this point to be valid, but we would like to add some comments. From the reference they used [2] it looks like they consider the units of that WHO standard as SI units, that by definition have recognized dimensions and are independent of measurement procedure. However, this is not the case for biological controls where the measurand is classified as a class B. The three elements of a class B analyte, together making up the measurand, are the system (sample matrix) the component such as Ig class and target specificity, and the kind of quantity (e.g., the biological activity) [3]. As we commented in a previously published Editorial [4], the signal generated by antibody assays is influenced by the Ig class(es) involved and by the relative affinity to the antigenic targets, and thus to time after infection as a low affinity antibody response is raised in the early stages of infection and a high affinity characterizes past as well as chronic infections. Both factors (Ig classes andaffinity)will hamper the reliability of antibody standards that are usually preparedby pooling plasma specimens collected from many individuals whose infection stage is unknown. By a probabilistic estimate, majority of samples should come from people in late stages, with an overabundance of high affinity IgG, which willmake the standardization of different methods detecting only IgG, only IgMor all Ig classes (‘total’antibodyassays) an almost impossible task. A living example of the difficulties in manufacturing and using reliable standards for infectious diseases serology is provided by the standardization of IgG antibodies to Rubella virus, that has been proposed since many years but is still failing to reach a sustained agreement across assays, both in general and at the supposed ‘immunity’ threshold of 10 IU/mL [3]. We may therefore conclude that even adopting this target-based distinction proposed by Hansen et al. [1] will not be sufficient to harmonize, let alone standardize, the results generated by different SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays. We may also comment on this issue from a wider perspective. More than 30 years ago Roger Ekins established the two categories for assays employed in the biological sciences: analytical (or “structurally-specific”) and comparative (or ‘functionally specific’) [5], where the latter compare the relative effects of substances, or mixtures of substances, not necessarily of identical chemical structure, on a biological system and whose results should be representedbyunits of effect andnot byunits of “amount” of the substance(s) measured and therefore cannot be ‘standardized’ by the use of a calibrant. While this general statement may look harsh, we shall acknowledge that view and accept the metrologic imperfection of antibody assays. In this specific field, focusing on absolute thresholds or reference values does not looks feasible and efforts shall be better aimed to establish assay-independent ranges of antibody response that shall characterize different infection stages or satisfy clinical needs, such as establishing an adequate response to vaccination or the antibody levels that may trigger a medical intervention e.g., start or stop of a specific treatment or switch to a different schedule or drug combination.Whilewe totally agreewith the concerns raised by Hansen and Coll. to avoid an overflow of measurement units in laboratory medicine, which should create confusion *Corresponding author:MarioPlebani,DepartmentofMedicine-DIMED, University of Padova, Padova, Italy, E-mail: mario.plebani@unipd.it. https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0270-1711 Claudio Galli, Medical Affairs, Core Diagnostics, Abbott, Rome, Italy. https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0804-0387 Clin Chem Lab Med 2022; 60(7): 959–960",Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (CCLM),2022,secondary,doi:10.1515/cclm-2022-0392,35491541,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1515/cclm-2022-0392,
doi:10.3389/fmicb.2021.608478,Characterization of Spacesuit Associated Microbial Communities and Their Implications for NASA Missions,"Background Crewed National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) missions to other solar system bodies are currently being planned. One high-profile scientific focus during such expeditions would be life detection, specifically the discovery of past or present microbial life, if they exist. However, both humans and associated objects typically carry a high microbial burden. Thus, it is essential to distinguish between microbes brought with the expedition and those present on the exploring planets. Modern spacesuits are unique, customized spacecraft which provide protection, mobility and life support to crew during spacewalks, yet they vent, and the mobility of microbes through spacesuits has not been studied. Results To evaluate the microbial colonization of spacesuits, NASA used an Extravehicular Activity swab kit to examine viable microbial populations of 48 samples from spacesuits using both traditional microbiological methods and molecular sequencing methods. The cultivable microbial population ranged from below the detection limit to 9 × 102 colony forming units per 25 cm2 of sample and also significantly varied by the location. The cultivable microbial diversity was dominated by members of Bacillus, Arthrobacter, and Ascomycota. However, 16S rRNA-based viable bacterial burden ranged from 105 to 106 copies per 25 cm2 of sample. Shotgun metagenome sequencing revealed the presence of a diverse microbial population on the spacesuit surfaces, including Curtobacterium and Methylobacterium from across all sets of spacesuits in high abundance. Among bacterial species identified, higher abundance of Cutibacterium acnes, Methylobacterium oryzae, and M. phyllosphaerae reads were documented. Conclusion The results of this study provide evidence that identical microbial strains may live on the wrist joint, inner gauntlet, and outer gauntlet of spacesuits. This raises the possibility, but does not confirm that microbial contaminants on the outside of the suits could contaminate planetary science operations unless additional measures are taken. Overall, these data provide the first estimate of microbial distribution associated with spacesuit surfaces, which will help future mission planners develop effective planetary protection strategies.",Frontiers in Microbiology,2020,secondary,doi:10.3389/fmicb.2021.608478,34394013,8358432,https://doi.org/doi:10.3389/fmicb.2021.608478,

Our pre-registered cross-sectional study design included an online survey in 12 languages with instructions for self-administering chemosensory tests with ten household items. Between June 2020 and March 2021, 10,953 individuals participated. Of these, 3,356 self-reported a positive and 602 a negative COVID-19 diagnosis (COVID+ and COVID-, respectively); 1,267 were awaiting test results (COVID?). The rest reported no respiratory illness and were grouped by symptoms: sudden smell/taste changes (STC, N=4,445), other symptoms excluding smell or taste loss (OthS, N=832), and no symptoms (NoS, N=416). Taste, smell, and oral irritation intensities and self-assessed abilities were rated on visual analog scales. Compared to the NoS group, COVID+ was associated with a 21% reduction in taste (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 15-28%), 47% in smell (95%-CI: 37-56%), and 17% in oral irritation (95%-CI: 10-25%) intensity. In all groups, perceived intensity of smell (r=0.84), taste (r=0.68), and oral irritation (r=0.37) was correlated. Our findings suggest most reports of taste dysfunction with COVID-19 were genuine and not due to misinterpreting smell loss as taste loss (i.e., a classical taste-flavor confusion).

Today, there is still a need for affordable and reliable diagnostic tests for massive disease monitoring. Previously, a set of highly specific DNA-aptamers (C7/C9) binding to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein were isolated but its performance in clinical samples remained to be tested. Here, 242 samples were collected through three different methods and subjected to florescence-linked aptamer assays (FLAA) based on C7/C9 aptamers through two readout protocols. Then, a step-by-step statistical approach which included agreement tests, proportion comparisons and binomial and multinomial logistic regressions was used to predict optimal conditions for the novel C7/C9 FLAA test. RTqPCR threshold cycles, symptoms onset and processing time were influential factors on FLAA test results. Naturally occurring mutations on S were also detected and analyzed. Aminoacidic substitutions D614G and T732A appeared relevant for aptamer recognition although further studies are necessary.

The study aimed to assess if any differences among participants from both waves could be observed and if any difference in molecular diagnostic performance could be observed among the two sample types. Samples were transported immediately to the laboratory to ensure the highest possible sample quality without any freezing and thawing steps before processing. Nucleic acids from saliva and NPS were prospectively extracted and SARS‐CoV‐2 was detected using a real‐time reverse‐transcription polymerase chain reaction. All observed results were statistically analyzed. Although the results obtained with NP and saliva agreed overall, higher viral loads were observed in NP swabs regardless of the day of specimen collection in both SARS‐CoV‐2 epidemic waves. No significant difference could be observed between the two epidemic waves characterized by Delta or Omicron SARS‐CoV‐2. To note, Delta infection resulted in higher viral loads both in NP and saliva and more symptoms, including rhinorrhea, cough, and dyspnea, whereas Omicron wave patients more frequently reported sore throat. An increase in the mean log RNA of SARS‐CoV‐2 was observed with the number of expressed symptoms in both waves, however, the difference was not significant.

doi:10.1093/nargab/lqad030,DiSiR: fast and robust method to identify ligand–receptor interactions at subunit level from single-cell RNA-sequencing data,"Abstract Most cell–cell interactions and crosstalks are mediated by ligand–receptor interactions. The advent of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) techniques has enabled characterizing tissue heterogeneity at single-cell level. In the past few years, several methods have been developed to study ligand–receptor interactions at cell type level using scRNA-seq data. However, there is still no easy way to query the activity of a specific user-defined signaling pathway in a targeted way or to map the interactions of the same subunit with different ligands as part of different receptor complexes. Here, we present DiSiR, a fast and easy-to-use permutation-based software framework to investigate how individual cells are interacting with each other by analyzing signaling pathways of multi-subunit ligand-activated receptors from scRNA-seq data, not only for available curated databases of ligand–receptor interactions, but also for interactions that are not listed in these databases. We show that, when utilized to infer ligand–receptor interactions from both simulated and real datasets, DiSiR outperforms other well-known permutation-based methods, e.g. CellPhoneDB and ICELLNET. Finally, to demonstrate DiSiR’s utility in exploring data and generating biologically relevant hypotheses, we apply it to COVID lung and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovium scRNA-seq datasets and highlight potential differences between inflammatory pathways at cell type level for control versus disease samples.",NAR Genomics and Bioinformatics,2023,secondary,doi:10.1093/nargab/lqad030,36968431,10034587,https://doi.org/doi:10.1093/nargab/lqad030,

We have also carried out a case-control (death vs. release) analysis without considering the time to event information. We observed that risk factors can be detected by either case-control or survival analysis, even though the goal of the two is quite different. We also observed that the two survival analyses may not both reveal a factor being a risk factor, but only one of them does. We prefer this two rounds of Cox regressions over mixture cure model which is only focused on time-to-death events which usually are sample size limited. By utilizing time-to-release events may greatly increase the sample size needed for revealing risk factors for COVID-19.

The clinical picture is characterized by a multiorgan involvement and an insufficiently known response to therapy. Objectives - Retrospective analysis carried out in the Paediatric Department of the Ravenna Hospital from April 2020 to March 2022 of the cases admitted with MIS-C, with description of the presentation characteristics, the differences with respect to Kawasaki disease and the therapeutic strategies adopted also with regard to the clinical response. Results - Thirteen cases diagnosed with MIS-C with an average age of 6 years and four months were hospitalized, 4 cases were of Italian origin, 6 of Balkan and 3 of African. All the cases presented with fever> 39 ° C with severe malaise / irritability, associated with skin rash in 9 cases, conjunctivitis in 7 and cheilitis in 5. The most prominent manifestations of organ involvement were abdominal pain / diarrhoea (N = 9), myocardial dysfunction in the absence of coronary involvement (N = 5), presence of pulmonary thickening (N = 5), painful laterocervical lymphadenitis with reduced neck motility (N = 5), subnephrotic proteinuria (N = 7) and hypertransaminasaemia (N = 8). Two cases with “encephalitic-like” psychomotor slowing, one with important ascites and one with oedema of the para/retropharyngeal tissues were clinically relevant for the severity of the onset. Twelve cases were treated with IVIG and methylprednisolone (2 mg /kg), 4 of them were found to be non-responders and required the use of steroid boluses (4 cases) and anakinra (4 cases), in three of the latter in association with steroid boluses, with rapid and decisive clinical response. Conclusions - The serious clinical manifestations that characterize MIS-C do not concern only cardiac involvement. Therapy with an IL-1 inhibitor, anakinra, must also be envisaged as a possible first-line treatment in case of a particularly severe clinical picture at the onset.",Medico e Bambino,2022,secondary,doi:10.53126/meb41299,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.53126/meb41299,
doi:10.3390/jcm11092676,COVID-19 Vaccination in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD),"Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are believed to play a key role in the suppression of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, patients suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) were excluded from SARS-CoV-2 vaccines trials. Therefore, concerns regarding vaccination efficacy and safety among those patients were raised. Overall, vaccination is well tolerated in the IBD population, and different gastroenterological societies recommend vaccinating patients with IBD at the earliest opportunity to do so. Nevertheless, very little is known about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in special IBD populations such as pregnant and breastfeeding women or pediatric patients, and further research on this matter is crucial. The available data on vaccine efficacy are promising and show high seroconversion rates in IBD patients on different immune-modifying therapies. However, patients treated with high doses of systemic corticosteroids, infliximab or infliximab and immunomodulators may have a blunted response to the vaccination. The data on COVID-19 vaccination willingness among patients with IBD are conflicting. Nevertheless, vaccine effectiveness and safety are reported to be the most common reasons for hesitancy. This review examines the effectiveness and safety of COVID-19 vaccines and describes vaccination willingness and the reasons for potential hesitancy among patients with IBD.",Journal of Clinical Medicine,2022,secondary,doi:10.3390/jcm11092676,35566802,9104993,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/jcm11092676,

To address the specific antibody targets that were affected by recent viral variants, we generated 43 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from 10 convalescent donors that bound three distinct domains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike. Viral variants harboring mutations at K417, E484 and N501 could escape most of the highly potent antibodies against the receptor binding domain (RBD). Despite this, we identified 12 neutralizing mAbs against three distinct regions of the spike protein that neutralize SARS-CoV-2 and the variants of concern, including B.1.1.7 (alpha), P.1 (gamma) and B.1.617.2 (delta). Notably, antibodies targeting distinct epitopes could neutralize discrete variants, suggesting different variants may have evolved to disrupt the binding of particular neutralizing antibody classes. These results underscore that humans exposed to wildtype (WT) SARS-CoV-2 do possess neutralizing antibodies against current variants and that it is critical to induce antibodies targeting multiple distinct epitopes of the spike that can neutralize emerging variants of concern.",Research Square,2021,secondary,doi:10.21203/rs.3.rs-678247/v1,34312615,8312900,https://doi.org/doi:10.21203/rs.3.rs-678247/v1,

Clinical presentations are highly variable and include fever, gastrointestinal (GI) disease, shock, and Kawasaki Disease-like illness (MIS-C/KD). Compared to patients with acute COVID, patients with MIS-C have a distinct immune signature and expansion of TRVB11 expressing T cells. However, the relationship between immunological and clinical phenotypes of MIS-C is unknown. Here, we measured serum biomarkers, TCR repertoire, and SARS-CoV2-specific T cell responses in a cohort of 76 MIS-C patients. Serum biomarkers associated with macrophage and Th1 activation were elevated in patients with shock, consistent with previous reports. Significantly increased SARS-CoV-2-induced IFN-g; IL-2, and TNF-a; production were seen in CD4+ T cells from patients with neurologic involvement and respiratory failure. Diarrhea was associated with a significant reduction in shock-associated serum biomarkers, suggesting a protective effect. TRVB11 usage was highly associated with MIS-C/KD and coronary aneurysms, suggesting a potential biomarker for these manifestations in MIS-C patients.

doi:10.1101/2022.10.06.511217,Pangenome Graph Construction from Genome Alignment with Minigraph-Cactus,"Reference genomes provide mapping targets and coordinate systems but introduce biases when samples under study diverge sufficiently from them. Pangenome references seek to address this by storing a representative set of diverse haplotypes and their alignment, usually as a graph. Alternate alleles determined by variant callers can be used to construct pangenome graphs, but thanks to advances in long-read sequencing, high-quality phased assemblies are becoming widely available. Constructing a pangenome graph directly from assemblies, as opposed to variant calls, leverages the graph’s ability to consistently represent variation at different scales and reduces biases introduced by reference-based variant calls. Pangenome construction in this way is equivalent to multiple genome alignment. Here we present the Minigraph-Cactus pangenome pipeline, a method to create pangenomes directly from whole-genome alignments, and demonstrate its ability to scale to 90 human haplotypes from the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium (HPRC). This tool was designed to build graphs containing all forms of genetic variation while still being practical for use with current mapping and genotyping tools. We show that this graph is useful both for studying variation within the input haplotypes, but also as a basis for achieving state of the art performance in short and long read mapping, small variant calling and structural variant genotyping. We further measure the effect of the quality and completeness of reference genomes used for analysis within the pangenomes, and show that using the CHM13 reference from the Telomere-to-Telomere Consortium improves the accuracy of our methods, even after projecting back to GRCh38. We also demonstrate that our method can apply to nonhuman data by showing improved mapping and variant detection sensitivity with a Drosophila melanogaster pangenome.",bioRxiv,2023,secondary,doi:10.1101/2022.10.06.511217,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2022.10.06.511217,

Methods  The demographic data and information on the ophthalmologic and other systemic organ manifestations, laboratory findings, treatment modalities, and clinical outcomes of 97 patients with MIS-C were retrospectively obtained from their hospital records. Sixty-two patients with MIS-C who were examined by ophthalmologists were included in the study. Statistical analysis was performed using R version 3.6.0, and a p- value < 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant. Results  The patients' median age was 82 months (range, 11–204 months). Of the patients, 62.9% were male. The most common systemic involvements were mucocutaneous (83.9%) and cardiovascular (82.3%). Kawasaki disease was clinically observed in 71% of the patients (incomplete form, 53.2%). Ophthalmic involvement was observed in 39 patients (62.9%). Thirty-two patients (51.6%) had conjunctival hyperemia; 29 (48.4%) lid edema; 7 follicular conjunctivitis; 3 uveitis; 2 subconjunctival hemorrhage; and 1 episcleritis.

The reason for variable clinical manifestations is not understood. Here, we carried out TCR sequencing and conducted comparative analyses of TCR repertoires between children with severe (n=12) or mild (n=8) COVID-19. We compared these repertoires with unexposed individuals (samples collected pre-COVID-19 pandemic: n=8) and with the Adaptive Biotechnologies MIRA dataset, which includes over 135,000 high-confidence SARS-CoV-2-specific TCRs. We show that the repertoires of severely ill children are characterised by the expansion of TRBV11-2 chains with high junctional and CDR3 diversity. Moreover, the CDR3 sequences of TRBV11-2 clones shift away from SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell clones, resulting in distorted TCR repertoires.

The serum neutralizing activity of antibodies elicited by infection with both early 2020 viruses and B.1.351 is heavily focused on the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD). However, within the RBD, B.1.351-elicited antibodies are more focused on the “class 3” epitope spanning sites 443 to 452, and neutralization by these antibodies is notably less affected by mutations at residue 484.

SARS-CoV-2 is predicted to remain prevalent for the foreseeable future, making the ability to identify SARS-CoV-2 variants imperative in understanding and controlling the pandemic. The predominant variant discovery method, genome sequencing, is time-consuming, insensitive, and expensive. Ultraperformance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) offers an exciting alternative detection modality provided that variant-containing peptide markers are sufficiently detectable from their tandem mass spectra (MS/MS). We have synthesized model tryptic peptides of SARS-CoV-2 variants alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and omicron and evaluated their signal intensity, HCD spectra, and reverse phase retention time. Detection limits of 781, 781, 65, and 65 amol are obtained for the molecular ions of the proteotypic peptides, beta (QIAPGQTGNIADYNYK), gamma (TQLPSAYTNSFTR), delta (VGGNYNYR), and omicron (TLVKQLSSK), from neat solutions. These detection limits are on par with the detection limits of a previously reported proteotypic peptide from the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, HTPINLVR.

Methods: All patients with serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 500 U/L or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > 500 U/L between June 1, 2018, and May 31, 2022, at The Hospital for Sick Children, were identified. Subjects with only AST > 500 U/L were excluded. Clinical characteristics, investigations, and outcomes for patients without clear etiology for ALT > 500 U/L (severe acute hepatitis of unknown etiology) for our study period and from October 1 to May 31 of each year 2018–2021 were reviewed. Results: Of 977 patients with ALT/AST> 500 U/L, 720 had only ALT > 500 U/L.

Twenty patients (60.6%) were tested for blood adenovirus by PCR, and 1 (5%) was positive (serotype B7). Liver tissue specimens from 18 patients revealed no evidence of viral inclusions or adenovirus. Twelve (36.3%) presented with pediatric acute liver failure, with 8 (24.2%) requiring liver transplantation. There were no deaths. Hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia occurred in 5 (15%) patients. Conclusions: Of children presenting with severe acute hepatitis to a quaternary children’s hospital over a 48-month period, 9.8% had unknown etiology with no change over time.

This paper integrates currently disparate measures of innate hyperactivation in severe COVID-19 and its autoimmune complications, and relates these to SARS-CoV-2 activation of innate immunity. Aggregated data include activation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD) receptors, NOD leucine-rich repeat and pyrin-domain-containing receptors (NLRPs), retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma-differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA-5). SARS-CoV-2 mainly activates the virus-associated innate receptors TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, NLRP3, RIG-1 and MDA-5. Severe COVID-19, however, is characterized by additional activation of TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6, NOD1 and NOD2, which are primarily responsive to bacterial antigens. The innate activation patterns in autoimmune coagulopathies, myocarditis and Kawasaki disease, or MIS-C, mimic those of severe COVID-19 rather than SARS-CoV-2 alone suggesting that autoimmunity follows combined SARS-CoV-2-bacterial infections. Viral and bacterial receptors are known to synergize to produce the increased inflammation required to support autoimmune disease pathology.

METHODS
We retrospectively collected the data of all MIS-C cases admitted to the Gaslini Children's Hospital, the hub for SARS-CoV-2 related diseases in Liguria region, Italy, from 01 October 2020, to 30 November 2022, evaluating the ratio between MIS-C cases and (1) COVID-19 paediatric cases in our region, (2) emergency department admissions and (3) emergency department febrile patients. We also compared MIS-C incidence in pre- post-vaccination periods.


RESULTS
We observed a significant global decline in the incidence of MIS-Cover the four variant periods and after the starting of vaccination whereas clinical features, therapeutic management and severity did not significantly vary.


CONCLUSIONS
In our setting, we demonstrated a significant decrease of MIS-C incidence according to the predominant variant and including not vaccinated children. Regardless of variant type, the patients showed similar phenotypes and severity throughout the pandemic.

SARS-CoV-2 data sets do not fit this mold. There are currently over 14 million sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes in online databases, with tens of thousands of new genomes added every day. Continuous data collection, combined with the public health relevance of SARS-CoV-2, invites an “online” approach to phylogenetics, in which new samples are added to existing phylogenetic trees every day. The extremely dense sampling of SARS-CoV-2 genomes also invites a comparison between likelihood and parsimony approaches to phylogenetic inference. Maximum likelihood (ML) and pseudo-ML methods may be more accurate when there are multiple changes at a single site on a single branch, but this accuracy comes at a large computational cost, and the dense sampling of SARS-CoV-2 genomes means that these instances will be extremely rare because each internal branch is expected to be extremely short. Therefore, it may be that approaches based on maximum parsimony (MP) are sufficiently accurate for reconstructing phylogenies of SARS-CoV-2, and their simplicity means that they can be applied to much larger data sets. Here, we evaluate the performance of de novo and online phylogenetic approaches, as well as ML, pseudo-ML, and MP frameworks for inferring large and dense SARS-CoV-2 phylogenies. Overall, we find that online phylogenetics produces similar phylogenetic trees to de novo analyses for SARS-CoV-2, and that MP optimization with UShER and matOptimize produces equivalent SARS-CoV-2 phylogenies to some of the most popular ML and pseudo-ML inference tools. MP optimization with UShER and matOptimize is thousands of times faster than presently available implementations of ML and online phylogenetics is faster than de novo inference. Our results therefore suggest that parsimony-based methods like UShER and matOptimize represent an accurate and more practical alternative to established ML implementations for large SARS-CoV-2 phylogenies and could be successfully applied to other similar data sets with particularly dense sampling and short branch lengths.",Systematic Biology,2023,secondary,doi:10.1093/sysbio/syad031,37232476,10627557,https://doi.org/doi:10.1093/sysbio/syad031,
doi:10.31083/j.fbl2702074,Performance evaluation of four surrogate Virus Neutralization Tests (sVNTs) in comparison to the in vivo gold standard test.,"BACKGROUND
Several commercial surrogate Virus Neutralization Tests (sVNTs) have been developed in the last year. Neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies through interaction with Spike protein Receptor Binding Domain (S-RBD) can block the virus from entering and infecting host cells. However, there is a lack of information about the functional activity of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies that may be associated with protective responses. For these reasons, to counteract viral infection, the conventional virus neutralization test (VNT) is still considered the gold standard. The aim of this study was to contribute more and detailed information about sVNTs' performance, by determining in vitro the anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody concentration using four different commercial assays and then comparing the obtained data to VNT.


METHODS
Eighty-eight samples were tested using two chemiluminescence assays (Snibe and Mindray) and two ELISA assays (Euroimmun and Diesse). The antibody titers were subsequently detected and quantified by VNT.


RESULTS
The overall agreement between each sVNT and VNT was 95.45% for Euroimmun and 98.86% for Diesse, Mindray and Snibe. Additionally, we investigated whether the sVNTs were closer to the gold standard than traditional anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays S-RBD or S1 based, finding a higher agreement mean value for sVNTs (98.01 ± 1.705% vs 95.45 ± 1.921%; p < 0.05). Furthermore, Spearman's statistical analysis for the correlation of sVNT versus VNT showed r = 0.666 for Mindray; r = 0.696 for Diesse; r = 0.779 for Mindray and r = 0.810 for Euroimmun.


CONCLUSIONS
Our data revealed a good agreement between VNT and sVNTs. Despite the VNT still remains the gold standard, the sVNT might be a valuable tool for screening wider populations.",Frontiers in bioscience,2022,secondary,doi:10.31083/j.fbl2702074,35227017,,https://doi.org/doi:10.31083/j.fbl2702074,

Pathogenic germline variants in WRAP53 encoding telomere Cajal body protein 1 (TCAB1) are a known cause of dyskeratosis congenita. We identified a significant NGS error in WRAP53, c.1562dup, p.Ala522Glyfs*8 (rs755116516 G>‐/GG/GGG) that did not validate by Sanger sequencing. This error occurs because rs755116516 G>‐/GG/GGG (Chr17:7,606,714) is polymorphic, and variants at this site challenge the ability of NGS to accurately call the correct number of nucleotides in a homopolymer run. This was further complicated by the fact that chr17:7,606,721 (rs769202794) is multiallelic G>A, C, T, and that chr17:7,606,722 is also multiallelic (rs7640C>A/G/T and rs373064567C>delC).

In the context of SARS-COV-2, multi- ple models have been developed including Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) de- scribing variant frequency growth as well as Fixed Growth Advantage (FGA), Growth Advantage Random Walk (GARW) and Piantham parameterizations describing vari- ant Rt. These models provide estimates of variant fitness and can be used to forecast changes in variant frequency. We introduce a framework for evaluating real-time fore- casts of variant frequencies, and apply this framework to the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 during 2022 in which multiple new viral variants emerged and rapidly spread through the population. We compare models across representative countries with different intensities of genomic surveillance. Retrospective assessment of model accuracy high- lights that most models of variant frequency perform well and are able to produce reasonable forecasts. We find that the simple MLR model provides [~]0.6% median ab- solute error and [~]6% mean absolute error when forecasting 30 days out for countries with robust genomic surveillance. We investigate impacts of sequence quantity and quality across countries on forecast accuracy and conduct systematic downsampling to identify that 1000 sequences per week is fully sufficient for accurate short-term fore- casts.

In most disease stages and organs, discrete OXPHOS functions are blocked by the virus, and this is countered by the host broadly up regulating unblocked OXPHOS functions.

The entry of RSV into the host cell is mediated by stepwise structural changes in the surface RSV fusion (RSV-F) glycoprotein. Recent progress in structural and functional studies of RSV-F glycoprotein revealed conformation-dependent neutralizing epitopes which have become attractive targets for vaccine and therapeutic development. As RSV-F is present on viral surface in a trimeric form, a trivalent binding interaction between a candidate fusion inhibitor and the respective epitopes on each of the three monomers is expected to prevent viral infection at higher potency than a monovalent or bivalent inhibitor. Here we demonstrate a novel RSV entry inhibitory approach by implementing a trimeric DNA nanostructure as a template to display up to three linear peptide moieties that simultaneously target an epitope on the surface of the prefusion RSV-F protein. In order to design synthetic binding peptides that can be coupled to the DNA nanostructure, the prefusion RSV-F-specific monoclonal antibody (D25) was selected. Complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) derived peptides underwent truncation and alanine-scanning mutagenesis analysis, followed by systematic sequence modifications using non-canonical amino acids. The most effective peptide candidate was used as a binding moiety to functionalize the DNA nanostructure. The designed DNA-peptide construct was able to block RSV infection on cells more efficiently than the monomeric peptides, however a more moderate reduction of viral load was observed in the lungs of infected mice upon intranasal application, likely due to dissociation or absorption of the underlying DNA structure by cells in the lungs. Taken together, our results point towards the inhibitory potential of a novel trimeric DNA-peptide based approach against RSV and open the possibility to apply this platform to target other viral infections.",,2022,secondary,doi:10.3389/fviro.2022.994843,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.3389/fviro.2022.994843,

Curated ARG databases exist together with assorted ARG classification approaches (e.g., database alignment, machine learning). Besides ARGs that naturally occur in bacterial strains or are acquired through mobile elements, there are chromosomal genes that can render a bacterium resistant to antibiotics through point mutations, i.e., ARG variants (ARGVs). While ARG repositories also collect ARGVs, there are only a few tools that are able to identify ARGVs from metagenomics and high throughput sequencing data, with a number of limitations (e.g., pre-assembly, a posteriori verification of mutations, or specification of species). In this work we present the k-mer, i.e., strings of fixed length k, ARGV analyzer –KARGVA– an open-source, multi-platform tool that provides: (i) an ad hoc, large ARGV database derived from multiple sources; (ii) input capability for various types of high-throughput sequencing data; (iii) a three-way, hash-based, k-mer search setup to process data efficiently, linking k-mers to ARGVs, k-mers to point mutations, and ARGVs to k-mers, respectively; (iv) a statistical filter on sequence classification to reduce type I and II errors. On semi-synthetic data, KARGVA provides very high accuracy even in presence of high sequencing errors or mutations (99.2% and 86.6% accuracy within 1% and 5% base change rates, respectively), and genome rearrangements (98.2% accuracy), with robust performance on ad hoc false positive sets. On data from the worldwide MetaSUB consortium, comprising 3,700+ metagenomics experiments, KARGVA identifies more ARGVs than Resistance Gene Identifier (4.8x) and PointFinder (6.8x), yet all predictions are below the expected false positive estimates.

However, the viral attachment and immune response initiated by the copy number and distribution pattern of SARS-CoV-2 RBDs remain poorly understood. Here, we organize SARS-CoV-2 RBDs on DNA nanoballs of ∼74 nm diameter by an aptamer-guided assembly for a systematic interrogation. We find that both the affinity and the rate of the DNA-based VLP binding to the host cell increase with the RBD number (10-90). In addition, a concentrated RBD distribution promotes faster and stronger interaction to the host cell than an even RBD distribution. Moreover, it is interesting to learn that the immunity activation does not increase linearly with RBD numbers on the VLP. As few as 20 evenly distributed RBDs per VLP can elicit up to 86% immunity of macrophage cells. Overall, the work provides a new tool to study SARS-CoV-2 infection and VLP-based immunity activation, which should deepen our understanding of viral infection and facilitate the development of highly effective antiviral vaccines.",Journal of the American Chemical Society,2022,secondary,doi:10.1021/jacs.2c09229,36356984,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1021/jacs.2c09229,

doi:10.3389/fneph.2023.1179342,Predicting SARS-CoV-2 infection among hemodialysis patients using multimodal data,"Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created more devastation among dialysis patients than among the general population. Patient-level prediction models for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are crucial for the early identification of patients to prevent and mitigate outbreaks within dialysis clinics. As the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, it is unclear whether or not previously built prediction models are still sufficiently effective. Methods We developed a machine learning (XGBoost) model to predict during the incubation period a SARS-CoV-2 infection that is subsequently diagnosed after 3 or more days. We used data from multiple sources, including demographic, clinical, treatment, laboratory, and vaccination information from a national network of hemodialysis clinics, socioeconomic information from the Census Bureau, and county-level COVID-19 infection and mortality information from state and local health agencies. We created prediction models and evaluated their performances on a rolling basis to investigate the evolution of prediction power and risk factors. Result From April 2020 to August 2020, our machine learning model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.75, an improvement of over 0.07 from a previously developed machine learning model published by Kidney360 in 2021. As the pandemic evolved, the prediction performance deteriorated and fluctuated more, with the lowest AUROC of 0.6 in December 2021 and January 2022. Over the whole study period, that is, from April 2020 to February 2022, fixing the false-positive rate at 20%, our model was able to detect 40% of the positive patients. We found that features derived from local infection information reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were the most important predictors, and vaccination status was a useful predictor as well. Whether or not a patient lives in a nursing home was an effective predictor before vaccination, but became less predictive after vaccination. Conclusion As found in our study, the dynamics of the prediction model are frequently changing as the pandemic evolves. County-level infection information and vaccination information are crucial for the success of early COVID-19 prediction models. Our results show that the proposed model can effectively identify SARS-CoV-2 infections during the incubation period. Prospective studies are warranted to explore the application of such prediction models in daily clinical practice.",Frontiers in Nephrology,2023,secondary,doi:10.3389/fneph.2023.1179342,37675373,10479652,https://doi.org/doi:10.3389/fneph.2023.1179342,

The viral spike receptor possesses two surface areas of high mutagenic plasticity: the supersite in its N-terminal domain (NTD) that is recognised by all anti-NTD antibodies and its receptor binding domain (RBD) where 17 residues make contact with the human Ace2 protein (angiotensin I converting enzyme 2) and many neutralising antibodies bind. While NTD mutations appear at first glance very diverse, they converge on the structure of the supersite. The mutations within the RBD, on the other hand, hone in on only a small number of key sites (K417, L452, E484, N501) that are allosteric control points enabling spike to escape neutralising antibodies while maintaining or even gaining Ace2-binding activity. The D614G mutation is the hallmark of all variants, as it promotes viral spread by increasing the number of open spike protomers in the homo-trimeric receptor complex.

Constant occupation makes sufficient cleaning difficult to achieve. Thus, an autonomous, permanent, antimicrobial coating (AMC) could keep down the microbial burden on such surfaces. A photodynamic AMC was applied to frequently touched surfaces in buses. The microbial burden (colony forming units, cfu) was determined weekly and compared to equivalent surfaces in buses without AMC (references). The microbial burden ranged from 0–209 cfu/cm2 on references and from 0–54 cfu/cm2 on AMC. The means were 13.4 ± 29.6 cfu/cm2 on references and 4.5 ± 8.4 cfu/cm2 on AMC (p < 0.001). The difference in microbial burden on AMC and references was almost constant throughout the study. Considering a hygiene benchmark of 5 cfu/cm2, the data yield an absolute risk reduction of 22.6% and a relative risk reduction of 50.7%. In conclusion, photodynamic AMC kept down the microbial burden, reducing the risk of transmission of microorganisms. AMC permanently and autonomously contributes to hygienic conditions on surfaces in public transportation. Photodynamic AMC therefore are suitable for reducing the microbial load and closing hygiene gaps in public transportation.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,2021,secondary,doi:10.3390/ijerph19042325,35206511,8872155,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/ijerph19042325,

In limited-resource settings, traditional pathology infrastructure is often insufficient for timely diagnosis, leading to frequent diagnoses at advanced-stage disease where survival is poor. In this study, we investigate molecular diagnosis of KS performed in a point-of-care device to circumvent the limited infrastructure for traditional diagnosis.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Single-center quaternary children’s hospital. PATIENTS: Children with MIS-C admitted from May 2020 to February 2021(Original and Alpha variant cohort) and August 2021 to November 2021 (Delta variant cohort). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Continuous vital sign measurements, laboratory results, medications data, and hospital outcomes from all subjects were evaluated. Of the 134 patients (102 with Original/Alpha and 32 with Delta), median age was 9 years, 75 (56%) were male, and 61 (46%) were Hispanics. The cohort with Original/Alpha variant had more males (61% vs 41%; p = 0.036) and more respiratory/musculoskeletal symptoms on presentation compared with the Delta variant (p < 0.05). More patients in the Original/Alpha variant cohort received mechanical ventilation (16 vs 0; p = 0.009). Median hospital length of stay (LOS) was 7 days, and ICU LOS was 3 days for the entire cohort. ICU LOS was shorter in cohort with the Delta variant compared with the Original/Alpha variant (4 vs 2 d; p = 0.001). Only one patient had cardiac arrest, two needed extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and two needed left ventricular assist device (Impella, Danvers, MA), all in the Original/Alpha variant cohort; no mortality occurred in the entire cohort. MIS-C cohort associated with the Delta variant had lower INR, prothrombin time, WBCs, sodium, phosphorus, and potassium median values (p < 0.05) during hospitalization compared with the Original/Alpha variants. Hemodynamic assessment showed significant tachycardia in the Original/Alpha variants cohort compared with the Delta variant cohort (p < 0.05). INTERVENTIONS: None. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with MIS-C associated with the Delta variants had lower severity during hospitalization compared with the Original/Alpha variant.

Here, we report an accurate SV atlas in a population of 562 rhesus macaques, verified by two public SV benchmarks, an inhouse benchmark of eight macaque genomes with long-read sequencing and another inhouse benchmark of one macaque genome with whole-genome assembly. This accurate, quantitative SV map indicates stronger purifying selection on inversions, one type of poorly-clarified SVs to date, especially for those located on regulatory regions, suggesting a strategy for prioritizing inversions with the most important functions. Based on the distribution and the evolutionary features of these inversions in macaque population, we then identified 75 human-specific inversions, clarified their functional effects and prioritized them. Notably, the top-ranked inversions have substantially shaped the human transcriptome, through their dual-effects of reconfiguring the ancestral genomic architecture and introducing regional mutation hotspots at the inverted regions. As a proof-of-concept, we linked APCDD1, located on one of these inversions with the highest rank score and downregulated in human brains, to neuronal maturation. The accumulation of human-specific mutations on its promoter region, accelerated by the formation of the inversion, contributed to the decreased expression in humans. Notably, the overexpression of APCDD1 could accelerate the neuronal maturation, while its depletion in mice delays the neuronal maturation. This study thus highlights the contribution of SVs, especially the inversions, to the distinct features in human brain development.",bioRxiv,2023,secondary,doi:10.1101/2023.09.25.558917,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2023.09.25.558917,

Methods: This cross-sectional, longitudinal study included 36 patients with MIS-C. Patients were classified as follows: (1) patients presenting with Kawasaki-like features (group I = 11); (2) patients presenting with LV systolic dysfunction (group II = 9); and (3) other presentations (group III = 3). CXCL10/IP10 levels were measured upon admission and on days 3 and 7 of treatment. Results: Twenty patients were male and 16 were female. The median age of patients at diagnosis was 7.5 (1.5–17) years. All patients had a fever lasting for a median of 4 (2–7) days. Ten patients had LV systolic dysfunction. The duration of hospitalization was longer in group II. Lymphocyte and platelet counts were lower, whereas NT-pro-BNP, troponin-I, D-dimer, and CXCL10/IP10 levels were higher in group II.

Positive SARS-CoV-2 detections occurred at both WWTPs, and data on viral genome detection rate and quantification suggest that the pellet (i.e., the particulate resulting from the influent) is a sensitive matrix that permits reliable assessment of infection prevalence while reducing time to results. On the contrary, analysis of post-treatment matrices provides evidence of the decontamination efficacy of both WWTPs. Finally, direct sequencing of wastewater samples enabled us to identify B.1.177 and B.1.160 as the prevalent SARS-CoV-2 lineages circulating in Venice at the time of sampling.

doi:10.1101/2022.04.04.487040,Unbreakable DNA tension probes show that cell adhesion receptors detect the molecular force-extension curve of their ligands,"Integrin receptors transduce the mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix. Past studies using DNA probes showed that integrins sense the magnitude of ligand forces with pN resolution. An open question is whether integrin receptors also sense the force-extension trajectory of their ligands. The challenge in addressing this question pertains to the lack of molecular probes that can control force-extension trajectories independently of force magnitude. To address this limitation, we synthesized two reversible DNA probes that fold with identical self-complementary domains but with different topologies. Thus, these probes unfold at the same steady-state force magnitude but following different kinetic pathways to reach the fully extended ssDNA state. Hairpin-like probes unzip with a low barrier of 14 pN while the pseudo-knot-like probes shear at 59 pN. Confirming that we had created probes with different barriers of unfolding, we quantified platelet integrin forces and measured 50-fold more tension signal with the unzipping probes over the shearing probes. In contrast, fibroblasts opened both probes to similar levels indicating more static forces. Surprisingly, fibroblast mechanotransduction markers, such as YAP levels, fibronectin production, actin organization, and integrin activation were significantly elevated on unzipping probes. This demonstrates that integrin receptors within focal adhesions sense the molecular force-extension profile of their ligands and not only the magnitude of equilibrium mechanical resistance.",bioRxiv,2022,secondary,doi:10.1101/2022.04.04.487040,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2022.04.04.487040,

To address this gap, we collected dust samples from the cabins of two airlines, one with textile seats (TSC) and one with leather seats (LSC), and analyzed the exposure using shotgun metagenomics and LC/MS. Results showed that the abundances of 17 VFs and 11 risk chemicals were significantly higher in TSC than LSC (p < 0.01). The predominant VFs in TSC were related to adherence, biofilm formation, and immune modulation, mainly derived from facultative pathogens such as Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The predominant risk chemicals in TSC included pesticides/herbicides (carbofuran, bromacil, and propazine) and detergents (triethanolamine, diethanolamine, and diethyl phthalate).

Data, including clinical features and laboratory results, were analyzed and compared between groups. Results The median age of patients was significantly higher in group 1 than in group 2 (53 months [IQR, 24–81] vs. 15 months [IQR, 6–33], p = 0.001). The incidence of cervical lymphadenopathy was significantly higher (p = 0.017), while that of BCGitis was significantly lower in group 1 (p = 0.023), and patients had a significantly longer hospital stay (5 days [IQR, 3–8] vs. 3 days [IQR, 3–4], p = 0.008). In group 1, platelet count was significantly lower (p = 0.006), and hemoglobin and ferritin levels were significantly higher (p = 0.013 and p = 0.001, respectively) on the first admission day. Following treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), the platelet count was significantly lower (p = 0.015), and the percentage of neutrophils and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio were significantly higher in group 1 (p = 0.037 and p = 0.012). Although there was no statistical difference, patients requiring infliximab treatment due to prolonged fever was only in group 1. The incidence of cardiovascular complications did not differ between the groups. Conclusions Post-COVID KD showed a stronger inflammatory response than KD-alone, with no differences in cardiac complications.",Frontiers in Pediatrics,2022,secondary,doi:10.3389/fped.2022.1036306,36467487,9714663,https://doi.org/doi:10.3389/fped.2022.1036306,
doi:10.21203/rs.3.rs-3126314/v1,Phylogenetic affiliations and genomic characterization of novel bacterial species and their abundance in the International Space Station,"Abstract Background With the advent of long-term human habitation in space and on the moon, understanding how the built environment microbiome of space habitats differs from Earth habits, and how microbes survive, proliferate and spread in space conditions, is coming more and more important. The Microbial Tracking mission series has been monitoring the microbiome of the International Space Station (ISS) for almost a decade. During this mission series, six unique strains of Gram-positive bacteria, including two spore-forming and three non-spore-forming species, were isolated from the environmental surfaces of the International Space Station (ISS). Results The analysis of their 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed <99% similarities with previously described bacterial species. To further explore their phylogenetic affiliation, whole genome sequencing (WGS) was undertaken. For all strains, the gyrB gene exhibited <93% similarity with closely related species, which proved effective in categorizing these ISS strains as novel species. Average ucleotide identity (ANI) and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) values, when compared to any known bacterial species, were less than <94% and 50% respectively for all species described here. Traditional biochemical tests, fatty acid profiling, polar lipid, and cell wall composition analyses were performed to generate phenotypic characterization of these ISS strains. A study of the shotgun metagenomic reads from the ISS samples, from which the novel species were isolated, showed that only 0.1% of the total reads mapped to the novel species, supporting the idea that these novel species are rare in the ISS environments. In-depth annotation of the genomes unveiled a variety of genes linked to amino acid and derivative synthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups, pigments, and protein metabolism. Further analysis of these ISS-isolated organisms revealed that, on average, they contain 46 genes associated with virulence, disease, and defense. The main predicted functions of these genes are: conferring resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds, and enabling invasion and intracellular resistance. After conducting antiSMASH analysis, it was found that there are roughly 16 cluster types across the six strains, including β-lactone and type III polyketide synthase (T3PKS) clusters. Conclusions Based on these multi-faceted taxonomic methods, it was concluded that these six ISS strains represent five novel species, which we propose to name as follows: Arthrobacter burdickii IIF3SC-B10 T (=NRRL B-65660 T ), Leifsonia virtsii, F6_8S_P_1A T (=NRRL B-65661 T ), Leifsonia williamsii, F6_8S_P_1B T (=NRRL B-65662 T and DSMZ 115932 T ), Paenibacillus vandeheii, F6_3S_P_1C T (=NRRL B-65663 T and DSMZ 115940 T ), and Sporosarcina highlanderae F6_3S_P_2 T (=NRRL B-65664 T and DSMZ 115943 T ). Identifying and characterizing the genomes and phenotypes of novel microbes found in space habitats, like those explored in this study, is integral for expanding our genomic databases of space-relevant microbes. This approach offers the only reliable method to determine species composition, track microbial dispersion, and anticipate potential threats to human health from monitoring microbes on the surfaces and equipment within space habitats. By unraveling these microbial mysteries, we take a crucial step towards ensuring the safety and success of future space missions.",Research Square,2023,secondary,doi:10.21203/rs.3.rs-3126314/v1,37461605,10350232,https://doi.org/doi:10.21203/rs.3.rs-3126314/v1,

While the adenovirus and adenovirus-associated virus have emerged as leading etiologic suspects, we attempted to investigate a potential role for SARS-CoV-2 in the development of subsequent liver abnormalities. Design: We conducted a study utilizing retrospective cohorts of de-identified, aggregated data from the electronic health records of over 100 million patients contributed by US health care organizations. Results: Compared to propensity-score-matched children with other respiratory infections, children aged 1-10 years with COVID-19 had a higher risk of elevated transaminases (Hazard ratio (HR) (95% Confidence interval (CI)) 2.16 (1.74-2.69)) or total bilirubin (HR (CI) 3.02 (1.91-4.78)), or new diagnoses of liver diseases (HR (CI) 1.67 (1.21-2.30)) from one to six months after infection. Patients with pre-existing liver abnormalities, liver abnormalities surrounding acute infection, younger age (1-4 years), or illness requiring hospitalization all had similarly elevated risk. Children who developed liver abnormalities following COVID-19 had more pre-existing conditions than those who developed abnormalities following other infections. Conclusion: These results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 may prime the patient for subsequent development of liver infections or non-infectious liver diseases. While rare (~1 in 1,000), SARS-CoV-2 is a risk for subsequent abnormalities in liver function or the diagnosis of diseases of the liver.",medRxiv,2023,secondary,doi:10.1101/2023.09.21.23295905,37790424,10543044,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2023.09.21.23295905,

A novel variant of concern (VOC) named CAL.20C (B.1.427/B.1.429) was originally detected in California and is currently spreading throughout the US and 29 additional countries. It is unclear whether antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection or to the prototypic Wuhan-1 isolate-based vaccines will be impacted by the three B.1.427/B.1.429 S mutations: S13I, W152C and L452R. Here, we assessed neutralizing Ab responses following natural infection or mRNA vaccination using pseudoviruses expressing the wildtype or the B.1.427/B.1.429 S protein. Plasma from vaccinated or convalescent individuals exhibited neutralizing titers, which were reduced 3-6 fold against the B.1.427/B.1.429 variant relative to wildtype pseudoviruses. The RBD L452R mutation reduced or abolished neutralizing activity of 14 out of 35 RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), including three clinical-stage mAbs. Furthermore, we observed a complete loss of B.1.427/B.1.429 neutralization for a panel of mAbs targeting the N-terminal domain due to a large structural rearrangement of the NTD antigenic supersite involving an S13I-mediated shift of the signal peptide cleavage site. These data warrant closer monitoring of signal peptide variants and their involvement in immune evasion and show that Abs directed to the NTD impose a selection pressure driving SARS-CoV-2 viral evolution through conventional and unconventional escape mechanisms.",bioRxiv,2021,secondary,doi:10.1101/2021.03.31.437925,33821281,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2021.03.31.437925,

The traditional detection method is manually collection and re-detection, being cumbersome and time-consuming. Here we propose a virus aerosol detection method based on microfluidic inertial separation and spectroscopic analysis technology to rapidly and accurately detect aerosol particles in the air. The microfluidic chip is designed based on the principles of inertial separation and laminar flow characteristics, resulting in an average separation efficiency of 95.99% for 2 μm particles. We build a microfluidic chip composite spectrometer detection platform to capture the spectral information on aerosol particles dynamically. By employing machine-learning techniques, we can accurately classify different types of aerosol particles. The entire experiment took less than 30 min as compared with hours by PCR detection.

doi:10.1145/3503222.3507702,GenStore: a high-performance in-storage processing system for genome sequence analysis,"Read mapping is a fundamental step in many genomics applications. It is used to identify potential matches and differences between fragments (called reads) of a sequenced genome and an already known genome (called a reference genome). Read mapping is costly because it needs to perform approximate string matching (ASM) on large amounts of data. To address the computational challenges in genome analysis, many prior works propose various approaches such as accurate filters that select the reads within a dataset of genomic reads (called a read set) that must undergo expensive computation, efficient heuristics, and hardware acceleration. While effective at reducing the amount of expensive computation, all such approaches still require the costly movement of a large amount of data from storage to the rest of the system, which can significantly lower the end-to-end performance of read mapping in conventional and emerging genomics systems. We propose GenStore, the first in-storage processing system designed for genome sequence analysis that greatly reduces both data movement and computational overheads of genome sequence analysis by exploiting low-cost and accurate in-storage filters. GenStore leverages hardware/software co-design to address the challenges of in-storage processing, supporting reads with 1) different properties such as read lengths and error rates, which highly depend on the sequencing technology, and 2) different degrees of genetic variation compared to the reference genome, which highly depends on the genomes that are being compared. Through rigorous analysis of read mapping processes of reads with different properties and degrees of genetic variation, we meticulously design low-cost hardware accelerators and data/computation flows inside a NAND flash-based solid-state drive (SSD). Our evaluation using a wide range of real genomic datasets shows that GenStore, when implemented in three modern NAND flash-based SSDs, significantly improves the read mapping performance of state-of-the-art software (hardware) baselines by 2.07-6.05× (1.52-3.32×) for read sets with high similarity to the reference genome and 1.45-33.63× (2.70-19.2×) for read sets with low similarity to the reference genome.",Proceedings of the 27th ACM International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems,2022,secondary,doi:10.1145/3503222.3507702,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1145/3503222.3507702,
doi:10.1128/spectrum.00761-23,Neglected SARS-CoV-2 variants and potential concerns for molecular diagnostics: a framework for nucleic acid amplification test target site quality assurance,"ABSTRACT During the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 detection using nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) played a key role in clinical management and public health interventions. However, mutations could jeopardize NAAT-based detection if they occur in the NAAT target site, potentially resulting in false negative results. However, mutation monitoring is challenged as the exact location of commercial NAAT target sites is not divulged by manufacturers. This study sequenced commercial SARS-CoV-2 NAAT target sites to assess the impact of mutations occurring in these regions. The resulting sequences for the Xpert, Cobas, and ID NOW SARS-CoV-2 assays were queried against SARS-CoV-2 genome databases to identify mutations in circulating strains. Synthetic DNAs and clinical specimens harboring NAAT target site mutations were used to assess mutation impact. Of 17,600 NAAT target site mutation occurrences in a genome database, 269 compromised target detection. These represented 24 unique mutations that reduced NAAT target sensitivity and nine led to target detection failure. Only seven of these mutations were previously recognized. Overall, this reactive strategy along with passive surveillance identified 29 novel mutations that compromised detection with Xpert and Cobas targets. Knowledge of commercial NAAT target sites, paired with a strategy for mutation impact assessment and ongoing genetic surveillance, provided a robust framework for commercial NAAT target site quality assurance. The question remains of who should be responsible for NAAT target site quality assurance, but collaborative efforts between methods users, industry, and regulatory agencies would be ideal. IMPORTANCE Molecular tests like polymerase chain reaction were widely used during the COVID-19 pandemic but as the pandemic evolved, so did SARS-CoV-2. This virus acquired mutations, prompting concerns that mutations could compromise molecular test results and be falsely negative. While some manufacturers may have in-house programs for monitoring mutations that could impact their assay performance, it is important to promptly report mutations in circulating viral strains that could adversely impact a diagnostic test result. However, commercial test target sites are proprietary, making independent monitoring difficult. In this study, SARS-CoV-2 test target sites were sequenced to monitor and assess mutations impact, and 29 novel mutations impacting SARS-CoV-2 detection were identified. This framework for molecular test target site quality assurance could be adapted to any molecular test, ensuring accurate diagnostic test results and disease diagnoses.

doi:10.1101/2023.11.01.23297901,Equity and efficiency in global respiratory virus genomic surveillance,"Public health interventions for respiratory virus outbreaks increasingly rely on genomic sequencing for the rapid identification of new (variant) viruses. However, global sequencing efforts are unevenly distributed, with some high-income countries sequencing at >100,000 times the rate of many low-income countries. Given the importance of virus genomic sequencing and substantial global disparities in sequencing capacities, there is a need for meaningful minimum sequencing targets and functional upper bounds that maximise resource efficiency. Here, using mathematical models and analyses of data on global SARS-CoV-2 sequencing output in 2022, we show that increases in sequencing rates typical of low-income countries are >100-fold more effective at reducing time to detection of new variants than increases from rates typical of high-income countries. We find that relative to 2022 sequencing rates, establishing a minimum respiratory virus sequencing capacity of two sequences per million people per week (S/M/wk) with a two-week time from sample collection to sequence deposition in all countries, while simultaneously capping sequencing rates at 30 S/M/wk in all countries, could reduce mean time to first variant detection globally by weeks-to-months while also reducing global sequencing output by >60%.

As an alternative diagnostic test, we present urine analysis through flow-injection–tandem mass spectrometry (FIA-MS/MS) as a powerful approach for COVID-19 diagnosis, targeting the detection of amino acids and acylcarnitines. We adapted a method that is widely used for newborn screening tests on dried blood for urine samples in order to detect metabolites related to COVID-19 infection. We analyzed samples from 246 volunteers with diagnostic confirmation via PCR. Urine samples were self-collected, diluted, and analyzed with a run time of 4 min.

Additionally, we predicted on two withheld sets composed of suspected hospitalized/symptomatic COVID-19-PCR negative patients and patients out of the optimal time-frame collection for PCR diagnosis, with promising results.

doi:10.1111/eci.14149,Serological markers and long COVID-A rapid systematic review.,"BACKGROUND
Long COVID is highly heterogeneous, often debilitating, and may last for years after infection. The aetiology of long COVID remains uncertain. Examination of potential serological markers of long COVID, accounting for clinical covariates, may yield emergent pathophysiological insights.


METHODS
In adherence to PRISMA guidelines, we carried out a rapid review of the literature. We searched Medline and Embase for primary observational studies that compared IgG response in individuals who experienced COVID-19 symptoms persisting ≥12 weeks post-infection with those who did not. We examined relationships between serological markers and long COVID status and investigated sources of inter-study variability, such as severity of acute illness, long COVID symptoms assessed and target antigen(s).


RESULTS
Of 8018 unique records, we identified 29 as being eligible for inclusion in synthesis. Definitions of long COVID varied. In studies that reported anti-nucleocapsid (N) IgG (n = 10 studies; n = 989 participants in aggregate), full or partial anti-Spike IgG (i.e. the whole trimer, S1 or S2 subgroups, or receptor binding domain, n = 19 studies; n = 2606 participants), or neutralizing response (n = 7 studies; n = 1123 participants), we did not find strong evidence to support any difference in serological markers between groups with and without persisting symptoms. However, most studies did not account for severity or level of care required during acute illness, and other potential confounders.


CONCLUSIONS
Pooling of studies would enable more robust exploration of clinical and serological predictors among diverse populations. However, substantial inter-study variations hamper comparability. Standardized reporting practices would improve the quality, consistency and comprehension of study findings.",European journal of clinical investigation,2023,secondary,doi:10.1111/eci.14149,38083997,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1111/eci.14149,
doi:10.3390/v13101974,Global Prevalence of Adaptive and Prolonged Infections’ Mutations in the Receptor-Binding Domain of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein,"Several vaccines with varying efficacies have been developed and are currently administered globally to minimize the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Despite having an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase with a proofreading activity, new variants of SARS-CoV-2 are on the rise periodically. Some of the mutations in these variants, especially mutations on the spike protein, aid the virus in transmission, infectivity and host immune evasion. Further, these mutations also reduce the effectiveness of some of the current vaccines and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). In the present study, using the available 984,769 SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide sequences on the NCBI database from the end of 2019 till 28 July 2021, we have estimated the global prevalence of so-called ‘adaptive mutations’ and ‘mutations identified in the prolonged infections’, in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein. Irrespective of the geographical region, in the case of the adaptive mutations, N501Y (48.38%) was found to be the dominant mutation followed by L452R (17.52%), T478K (14.31%), E484K (4.69%), S477N (3.29%), K417T (1.64%), N439K (0.7%) and S494P (0.7%).

The basic principles, analytical methods, and applications of hybrid impedimetric biosensors for express protein detection in biological fluids are described. The advantages of this type of biosensors, such as simplicity and speed of operation, sensitivity and selectivity of analysis, cost-effectiveness, and an ability to be integrated into hybrid microfluidic systems, are demonstrated. Current challenges and development prospects in this area are analyzed. They include (a) the selection of materials for electrodes and formation of nanostructures on their surface; (b) the development of efficient methods for biorecognition elements’ deposition on the electrodes’ surface, providing the specificity and sensitivity of biosensing; (c) the reducing of nonspecific binding and interference, which could affect specificity; (d) adapting biosensors to real samples and conditions of operation; (e) expanding the range of detected proteins; and, finally, (f) the development of biosensor integration into large microanalytical system technologies. This review could be useful for researchers working in the field of impedimetric biosensors for protein detection, as well as for those interested in the application of this type of biosensor in biomedical diagnostics.",Micromachines,2024,secondary,doi:10.3390/mi15020181,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/mi15020181,
doi:10.3390/covid3060066,LAMP-Based Point-of-Care Nucleic Acid-Based Detection Method Can Be Useful for Quick Decision-Making for Diagnosis of Acute COVID-19 Emergency Cases in Hospital Settings,"Real-time RT-PCR is used as a gold standard method for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Since real-time RT PCR is nucleic acid-based, it is a highly sensitive and specific test. However, this test takes 4–8 h to generate results and, in emergency settings, this delay may prove fatal for certain patients. The frequent surge in COVID cases increases patient load in emergency settings. Thus, a nucleic acid-based rapid POC test is required that can generate results quickly as well as being comparable to real-time RT-PCR. In this study, comparison of real-time RT-PCR was carried out using the rapid nucleic acid-based LAMP method. Nasopharyngeal swabs were taken in duplicate from patients visiting the kiosk and were analyzed for the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus by both real-time RT-PCR and LAMP techniques ID NOW(bbott). Out of 14 positive and 31 negative samples tested by real-time RT-PCR, 13 samples were identified as positive and 31 were observed as negative with the LAMP-based test. Hence, the sensitivity and specificity of this method were found to be 92.9% and 93.5%, respectively. Therefore, LAMP-based point-of-care testing has the potential to be used in hospital emergency settings for quick diagnosis of critically ill patients, and the information generated here will further draw the attention of policymakers toward such nucleic acid-based rapid tests.",COVID,2023,secondary,doi:10.3390/covid3060066,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/covid3060066,

This review aims to describe for the first time the prevalence, aetiology, prognostic value, pathophysiology, and management of hyponatraemia in children and adolescents with COVID-19, taking into account all relevant studies published in PubMed and Cochrane Library studies until 26th September 2021. Literature search did not detect any studies evaluating the prevalence and prognostic value of sodium disorders in paediatric patients with COVID-19. A broader literature review showed a high prevalence of hyponatraemia in children with bacterial pneumonia, while some studies have reported that hyponatraemia is relatively common in Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C). In adults with COVID-19, an inverse association between sodium and interleukin-6 levels has been found, indicating that hyponatraemia could be used as a surrogate marker for the risk of cytokine storm and may facilitate the identification of patients who could benefit from immunomodulatory agents. Studies are urgently needed to evaluate the frequency and prognostic impact of electrolyte abnormalities in children with COVID-19. In the meantime, clinicians are urged to consider hyponatraemia in children with COVID-19 as a potential red flag, investigate the cause and administer fluids and other therapies accordingly.

Here, we conducted a longitudinal study to investigate gene expression patterns during acute SARS-CoV-2 illness. Cases included SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals with extremely high viral loads early in their illness, individuals having low SARS-CoV-2 viral loads early in their infection, and individuals testing negative for SARS-CoV-2. We could identify widespread transcriptional host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection that were initially most strongly manifested in patients with extremely high initial viral loads, then attenuating within the patient over time as viral loads decreased. Genes correlated with SARS-CoV-2 viral load over time were similarly differentially expressed across independent datasets of SARS-CoV-2 infected lung and upper airway cells, from both in vitro systems and patient samples. We also generated expression data on the human nose organoid model during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The human nose organoid-generated host transcriptional response captured many aspects of responses observed in the above patient samples, while suggesting the existence of distinct host responses to SARS-CoV-2 depending on the cellular context, involving both epithelial and cellular immune responses.

Indeed, machine learning models for sensor signals have enabled a diverse range of healthcare related applications including early detection of abnormalities, fertility tracking, and adverse drug effect prediction. However, these models can fail to account for the dependent high-dimensional nature of the underlying sensor signals. In this paper, we introduce Latent Temporal Flows, a method for multivariate time-series modeling tailored to this setting. We assume that a set of sequences is generated from a multivariate probabilistic model of an unobserved time-varying low-dimensional latent vector. Latent Temporal Flows simultaneously recovers a transformation of the observed sequences into lower-dimensional latent representations via deep autoencoder mappings, and estimates a temporally-conditioned probabilistic model via normalizing flows. Using data from the Apple Heart and Movement Study (AH&MS), we illustrate promising forecasting performance on these challenging signals. Additionally, by analyzing two and three dimensional representations learned by our model, we show that we can identify participants' $\text{VO}_2\text{max}$, a main indicator and summary of cardio-respiratory fitness, using only lower-level signals. Finally, we show that the proposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art in multi-step forecasting benchmarks (achieving at least a $10\%$ performance improvement) on several real-world datasets, while enjoying increased computational efficiency.",,2022,secondary,doi:10.48550/arXiv.2210.07475,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.48550/arXiv.2210.07475,

The purpose of this study was to analyze the differences in single-cell RNA sequencing between KD and COVID-19. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing in KD patients (within 24 hours before IVIG treatment) and age-matched fever controls. The single-cell RNA sequencing data of COVID-19, influenza, and health controls were downloaded from the Sequence Read Archive (GSE149689/PRJNA629752). In total, 22 single-cell RNA sequencing data with 102,355 nuclei were enrolled in this study. After performing hierarchical and functional clustering analyses, two enriched gene clusters demonstrated similar patterns in severe COVID-19 and KD, heightened neutrophil activation, and decreased MHC class II expression. Furthermore, comparable dysregulation of neutrophilic granulopoiesis representing two pronounced hyperinflammatory states was demonstrated, which play a critical role in the overactivated and defective aging program of granulocytes, in patients with KD as well as those with severe COVID-19. In conclusion, both neutrophil activation and MHC class II reduction play a crucial role and thus may provide potential treatment targets for KD and severe COVID-19.",Frontiers in Immunology,2022,secondary,doi:10.3389/fimmu.2022.995886,36159873,9499176,https://doi.org/doi:10.3389/fimmu.2022.995886,
doi:10.1021/acs.analchem.3c00354,Ultrathin Silica Integration for Enhancing Reliability of Microfluidic Photoionization Detectors.,"Microfluidic photoionization detectors (μPIDs) based on silicon chips can rapidly and sensitively detect volatile compounds. However, the applications of μPID are limited by the manual assembly process using glue, which may outgas and clog the fluidic channel, and by the short lifetime of the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) lamps (especially, argon lamps). Here, we developed a gold-gold cold welding-based microfabrication process to integrate ultrathin (10 nm) silica into μPID. The silica coating enables direct bonding of the VUV window to silicon under amicable conditions and works as a moisture and plasma exposure barrier for VUV windows that are susceptible to hygroscopicity and solarization. Detailed characterization of the silica coating was conducted, showing that the 10 nm silica coating allows 40-80% VUV transmission from 8.5 to 11.5 eV. It is further shown that the silica-protected μPID maintained 90% of its original sensitivity after 2200 h of exposure to ambient (dew point = 8.0 ± 1.8 °C), compared to 39% without silica. Furthermore, argon plasma inside an argon VUV lamp was identified as the dominant degradation source for the LiF window with color centers formation in UV-vis and VUV transmission spectra. Ultrathin silica was then also demonstrated effective in protecting the LiF from argon plasma exposure. Lastly, thermal annealing was found to bleach the color centers and restore VUV transmission of degraded LiF windows effectively, which will lead to future development of a new type of VUV lamp and the corresponding μPID (and PID in general) that can be mass produced with a high yield, a longer lifetime, and better regenerability.",Analytical chemistry,2023,secondary,doi:10.1021/acs.analchem.3c00354,37278057,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1021/acs.analchem.3c00354,

Here, we present longitudinal profiling of immune responses during acute disease and following recovery in children who developed MIS-C, relative to children who experienced more typical symptoms of COVID-19. T cells in acute MIS-C exhibited transient signatures of activation, inflammation, and tissue residency which correlated with cardiac disease severity, while T cells in acute COVID-19 upregulated markers of follicular helper T cells for promoting antibody production. The resultant memory immune response in recovery showed increased frequencies of virus-specific memory T cells with pro-inflammatory functions in children with prior MIS-C compared to COVID-19 while both cohorts generated comparable antibody responses.

Researchers have become increasingly interested in the system for developing drugs to treat neuroinflammation. Currently, creating neurovascular models begins with animal models, followed by testing on humans in clinical trials. However, the high number of medication failures that pass through animal testing indicates that animal models do not always reflect the outcome of human clinical trials. To overcome the challenges of the issues with animal models, a neurovascular‐unit‐on‐a‐chip system is developed to accurately replicate the in vivo human neurovascular microenvironment. By replicating the human neurovascular unit, a more accurate representation of human physiology can be achieved compared to animal models. The ability to detect proinflammatory cytokines in situ and monitor physiological changes can provide an invaluable tool for evaluating the efficacy and safety of drugs. Using nanosized graphene oxide for in situ detection of inflammatory responses is an innovative approach that can advance the field of neuroinflammation research.

Here we show that adults with COVID-19 had a moderate prevalence of autoantibodies against the lung antigen KCNRG, and SLE-associated Smith autoantigen. Children with COVID-19 rarely had autoantibodies; one of 59 children had GAD65 autoantibodies associated with acute insulin-dependent diabetes. While autoantibodies associated with SLE/Sjogren syndrome (Ro52, Ro60, and La) and/or autoimmune gastritis (gastric ATPase) were detected in 74% (40/54) of MIS-C patients, further analysis of these patients and of children with Kawasaki disease (KD), showed that the administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was largely responsible for detection of these autoantibodies in both groups of patients. Monitoring in vivo decay of the autoantibodies in MIS-C children showed that the IVIG-derived Ro52, Ro60, and La autoantibodies declined to undetectable levels by 45-60 days, but gastric ATPase autoantibodies declined more slowly requiring >100 days until undetectable. Together these findings demonstrate that administration of high-dose IVIG is responsible for the detection of several autoantibodies in MIS-C and KD.

One challenge is that cell-generated forces are infrequent, transient, and difficult to detect. Here, we report the development of Mechano-Cas12a Assisted Tension Sensor (MCATS) that utilizes CRISPR-Cas12a to transduce and amplify the molecular forces generated by cells. We demonstrate the power of MCATS by detecting the forces generated by as few as ~103 human platelets in a high-throughput manner. Platelet forces are significantly inhibited when blood samples are treated with FDA-approved drugs such as aspirin, eptifibatide(integrilin®), 7E3(Reopro®), and ticagrelor (Brelinta®). Because MCATS requires <5uL of blood/measurement, a single blood draw can generate a personalized dose-response curve and IC50 for this panel of drugs. Platelet activity and force-generation are tightly associated, and hence MCATS was used to quantify platelet dysfunction following cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in a pilot study of 7 cardiac patients. We found that MCATS detected platelet dysfunction which strongly correlated with the need for platelet transfusion to limit bleeding.

Persistent clinical symptoms following resolution of initial infection, termed long COVID, are also hugely variable, but association with immunological changes has not been described. We investigate changing immunological parameters in convalescent COVID-19 and interrogate their potential relationships with persistent symptoms. Methods We performed paired immunophenotyping at initial SARS-CoV-2 infection and convalescence (n=40, median 68 days) and validated findings in 71 further patients at median 101 days convalescence. Results were compared to 40 pre-pandemic controls. Fatigue and exercise tolerance were assessed as cardinal features of long COVID using the Chalder Fatigue Scale and 6-minute-walk test. The relationships between these clinical outcomes and convalescent immunological results were investigated. Results We identify persistent expansion of intermediate monocytes, effector CD8+, activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and reduced naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells at 68 days, with activated CD8+ T cells remaining increased at 101 days. Patients >60 years also demonstrate reduced naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and expanded activated CD4+ T cells at 101 days. Ill-health, fatigue, and reduced exercise tolerance were common in this cohort. These symptoms were not associated with immune cell populations or circulating inflammatory cytokines.

A retrospective analysis of 26 children (0–21 years of age) admitted to Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta with a diagnosis of COVID-19 between March 17 and May 26, 2020 was undertaken. The patients were classified into three categories based on COVID-19 severity levels: asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic (control population, admitted for other non-COVID-19 conditions), mild/moderate, and severe COVID-19. A fourth category of children met the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's case definition for MIS-C. Residual blood samples were analyzed for OPN, a marker of inflammation using commercial ELISA kits (R&D), and results were correlated with clinical data. This study demonstrates that OPN levels are significantly elevated in children hospitalized with moderate and severe COVID-19 and MIS-C compared to OPN levels in mild/asymptomatic children. Further, OPN differentiated among clinical levels of severity in COVID-19, while other inflammatory markers including maximum erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein and ferritin, minimum lymphocyte and platelet counts, soluble interleukin-2R, and interleukin-6 did not.

The cause of this phenomenon in other hypersaline sites has been attributed to halophiles, Dunaliella, and Salinibacter, however, a systematic analysis of the microbial communities, their functional features, and the prevalence of pigment-producing-metabolisms has not been previously studied. Our results are evidence that Lake Hillier is composed of a diverse set of microorganisms including archaea, bacteria, algae, and viruses. Our data indicate a core microbiome in Lake Hillier composed of multiple pigment-producer microbes, many of which are cataloged as polyextremophiles. Additionally, we estimated the diversity of metabolic pathways in the lake and determined that many of these are related to pigment production.

Pediatric ICUs routinely admitted adult patients. Non-ICU areas were converted to ICUs and staff were redeployed from other essential service areas. Faced with a lack of critical care capacity, triage plans for ICU admission were developed and nearly implemented in some provinces. Twenty eight percent of patients in Canadian ICUs who required mechanical ventilation died. Surviving patients have required prolonged ICU admission, hospitalization and extensive ongoing rehabilitation. Family members of patients were not permitted to visit, resulting in additional psychological stresses to patients, families, and healthcare teams. ICU professionals also experienced extreme psychological stresses from caring for such large numbers of critically ill patients, often in sub-standard conditions.

Detection dogs could contribute to mass screening. Previous research demonstrated canines' ability to detect SARS-CoV-2-infections but has not investigated if dogs can differentiate between COVID-19 and other virus infections. Methods: Twelve dogs were trained to detect SARS-CoV-2 positive samples. Three test scenarios were performed to evaluate their ability to discriminate SARS-CoV-2-infections from viral infections of a different aetiology. Naso- and oropharyngeal swab samples from individuals and samples from cell culture both infected with one of 15 viruses that may cause COVID-19-like symptoms were presented as distractors in a randomised, double-blind study. Dogs were either trained with SARS-CoV-2 positive saliva samples (test scenario I and II) or with supernatant from cell cultures (test scenario III). Results: When using swab samples from individuals infected with viruses other than SARS-CoV-2 as distractors (test scenario I), dogs detected swab samples from SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals with a mean diagnostic sensitivity of 73.8% (95% CI: 66.0–81.7%) and a specificity of 95.1% (95% CI: 92.6–97.7%). In test scenario II and III cell culture supernatant from cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, cells infected with other coronaviruses and non-infected cells were presented. Dogs achieved mean diagnostic sensitivities of 61.2% (95% CI: 50.7–71.6%, test scenario II) and 75.8% (95% CI: 53.0–98.5%, test scenario III), respectively. The diagnostic specificities were 90.9% (95% CI: 87.3–94.6%, test scenario II) and 90.2% (95% CI: 81.1–99.4%, test scenario III), respectively. Conclusion: In all three test scenarios the mean specificities were above 90% which indicates that dogs can distinguish SARS-CoV-2-infections from other viral infections. However, compared to earlier studies our scent dogs achieved lower diagnostic sensitivities. To deploy COVID-19 detection dogs as a reliable screening method it is therefore mandatory to include a variety of samples from different viral respiratory tract infections in dog training to ensure a successful discrimination process.",Frontiers in Medicine,2021,secondary,doi:10.3389/fmed.2021.749588,34869443,8636992,https://doi.org/doi:10.3389/fmed.2021.749588,
doi:10.1542/peds.2023-063259,Updated Case Definition of MIS-C and Implications for Clinical Care.,"OBJECTIVES
A broad, surveillance case definition was implemented when multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) emerged in 2020. In 2023, a revised MIS-C case definition was constructed to improve specificity and reduce misclassification with other pediatric inflammatory conditions. This study aims to describe the impact of the updated definition on the classification of patients with MIS-C and Kawasaki Disease (KD).


METHODS
Patients hospitalized from March 2020 to November 2022 with clinician-diagnosed KD and MIS-C at a single center were studied retrospectively. Specificity and positive predictive value were assessed; McNemar test was used to compare specificity.


RESULTS
Among 119 patients with MIS-C per the 2020 definition, 20 (17%) did not fulfill the 2023 definition. Six of these 20 (30%) had shock or cardiac involvement. Of 59 KD patients, 10 (17%) met the 2020 MIS-C definition. Five patients (8%) met the 2023 MIS-C definition. Specificity for the 2020 and 2023 MIS-C definitions among KD patients were 83.1% and 91.5% respectively (McNemar, P = .0736). Positive predictive value was higher for the 2023 MIS-C case definition compared with the 2020 MIS-C case definition (95.2% vs 92.2%).


CONCLUSIONS
Approximately 1 in 5 patients diagnosed with MIS-C using the 2020 case definition did not meet the 2023 definition, including patients with cardiovascular dysfunction. Overlap persisted between patients meeting KD and 2023 MIS-C case definitions, with a false positive rate of 8%. Implications for treatment should be considered, particularly in settings where presumed MIS-C may be treated with corticosteroid monotherapy.",Pediatrics,2024,secondary,doi:10.1542/peds.2023-063259,38204335,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1542/peds.2023-063259,

Here, we aim to summarise the effects of climate change (i.e. raise of temperature, change in humidity or precipitation) on spread of antibiotic resistance and on infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria in Germany. Methods We conducted a literature search with articles published between January 2012 and July 2022. Two authors screened titles, abstracts and full texts and extracted the data systematically. Results From originally 2,389 titles, we identified six studies, which met our inclusion criteria. These studies show that an increase in temperature may lead to higher antibiotic resistance rates and an increased risk of colonisation as well as spread of pathogens. Furthermore, the number of healthcare-associated infections increases with increased temperature. Data indicate that higher antibiotic use is present in areas with warmer mean temperature. Conclusions European data are scarce, but all studies identified point towards an increasing AMR burden due to climate change.

However, thanks to an ever-expanding ecosystem of metagenomics-specific algorithms and file formats, designing studies, implementing seamless and scalable end-to-end workflows, and exploring the massive amounts of output data have become studies unto themselves. Furthermore, there is little inter-communication between output data of different analytic purposes, such as short-read classification and metagenome assembled genomes (MAG) reconstruction. One-click pipelines have helped to organize these tools into targeted workflows, but they suffer from general compatibility and maintainability issues. Results To address the gap in easily extensible yet robustly distributable metagenomics workflows, we have developed a module-based metagenomics analysis system written in Snakemake, a popular workflow management system, along with a standardized module and working directory architecture. Each module can be run independently or conjointly with a series of others to produce the target data format (ex. short-read preprocessing alone, or short-read preprocessing followed by de novo assembly), and outputs aggregated summary statistics reports and semi-guided Jupyter notebook-based visualizations, The module system is a bioinformatics-optimzied scaffold designed to be rapidly iterated upon by the research community at large.

Here, we develop an efficient and scalable wet lab and computational protocol for Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-read sequencing that seeks to provide a genuine alternative to short-reads for large-scale genomics projects. We applied our protocol to cell lines and brain tissue samples as part of a pilot project for the NIH Center for Alzheimer's and Related Dementias (CARD). Using a single PromethION flow cell, we can detect SNPs with F1-score better than Illumina short-read sequencing. Small indel calling remains to be difficult inside homopolymers and tandem repeats, but is comparable to Illumina calls elsewhere. Further, we can discover structural variants with F1-score comparable to state-of the-art methods involving Pacific Biosciences HiFi sequencing and trio information (but at a lower cost and greater throughput). Using ONT based phasing, we can then combine and phase small and structural variants at megabase scales. Our protocol also produces highly accurate, haplotype-specific methylation calls. Overall, this makes large-scale long-read sequencing projects feasible; the protocol is currently being used to sequence thousands of brain-based genomes as a part of the NIH CARD initiative.

doi:10.1101/2022.12.13.520298,Air-seq: Measuring air metagenomic diversity in an agricultural ecosystem,"Background All species shed DNA into their environment during life or in death providing an opportunity to monitor biodiversity via its environmental DNA. Biodiversity monitoring using environmental DNA based technologies has become an important tool in understanding ecosystems. In recent years promising progress for non-invasive and, more importantly, non-destructive monitoring has been made by combining the retrieval of information transmitted by released environmental DNA with high-throughput sequencing technologies. Important ecosystems under continuous threat by disease but essential for food supplies are agricultural systems, often farmed as large monocultures and so highly vulnerable to disease outbreaks. Pest and pathogen monitoring in agricultural ecosystems is therefore key for efficient and early disease prevention and management. Air is rich in biodiversity, but has the lowest DNA concentration of all environmental media and yet it is required for windborne spread by many of the world’s most damaging crop pathogens. Our work and recent research suggests that ecosystems can be monitored efficiently using airborne nucleic acid information. Results Here we show that the airborne DNA of microbes can be recovered, sequenced and taxonomically classified, including down to the species level. Monitoring a field growing key crops we show that Air-seq can identify the presence of agriculturally significant pathogens and quantify their changing abundance over a period of 1.5 months often correlating with weather variables. Conclusion We add to the evidence that aerial environmental DNA can be used as a source for biomonitoring in agricultural and more general terrestrial ecosystems. The ability to detect fluxes and occurrence patterns of species and strains with high throughput sample processing and analysis technologies highlights the value of airborne environmental DNA in monitoring biodiversity changes and tracking of taxa of human interest or concern.",bioRxiv,2022,secondary,doi:10.1101/2022.12.13.520298,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2022.12.13.520298,

The entire population was swab tested in two sequential surveys. Here we report the analysis of the viral genomes, which revealed that the unique ancestor haplotype introduced in Vo’ belongs to lineage B and, more specifically, to the subtype found at the end of January 2020 in two Chinese tourists visiting Rome and other Italian cities, carrying mutations G11083T and G26144T. The sequences, obtained for 87 samples, allowed us to investigate viral evolution while being transmitted within and across households and the effectiveness of the non-pharmaceutical interventions implemented in Vo’. We report, for the first time, evidence that novel viral haplotypes can naturally arise intra-host within an interval as short as two weeks, in approximately 30% of the infected individuals, regardless of symptoms severity or immune system deficiencies. Moreover, both phylogenetic and minimum spanning network analyses converge on the hypothesis that the viral sequences evolved from a unique common ancestor haplotype, carried by an index case. The lockdown extinguished both viral spread and the emergence of new variants, confirming the efficiency of this containment strategy. The information gathered from household was used to reconstructs possible transmission events. AUTHOR SUMMARY It is of great interest and importance to understand SARS-CoV-2 ability to mutate generating new viral strains, and to assess the impact of containment strategies on viral transmission. In this study we highlight the rapid intra-host haplotype evolution regardless of symptom severity and immune deficiencies that we observed during the first wave of the pandemic in the municipality of Vo’ in Italy. The confirmation that all the haplotypes found in this small community derive from a common ancestor haplotype, has allowed us to track the rapid emergence of new variants but lockdown and mass testing efficiently prevented their spread elsewhere.",bioRxiv,2021,secondary,doi:10.1101/2021.12.22.473949,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2021.12.22.473949,

Previous studies have confirmed that non-structural protein 13 (NSP13) plays an important role in immune evasion by physically interacting with TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) to inhibit IFNβ production. Mutations have been reported in NSP13; hence, in the current study, biophysical and structural modeling methodologies were adapted to dissect the influence of major mutations in NSP13, i.e., P77L, Q88H, D260Y, E341D, and M429I, on its binding to the TBK1 and to escape the human immune system. The results revealed that these mutations significantly affected the binding of NSP13 and TBK1 by altering the hydrogen bonding network and dynamic structural features. The stability, flexibility, and compactness of these mutants displayed different dynamic features, which are the basis for immune evasion. Moreover, the binding was further validated using the MM/GBSA approach, revealing that these mutations have higher binding energies than the wild-type (WT) NSP13 protein. These findings thus justify the basis of stronger interactions and evasion for these NSP13 mutants. In conclusion, the current findings explored the key features of the NSP13 WT and its mutant complexes, which can be used to design structure-based inhibitors against the SARS-CoV-2 new variants to rescue the host immune system.",Frontiers in Microbiology,2021,secondary,doi:10.3389/fmicb.2021.789062,34925297,8671833,https://doi.org/doi:10.3389/fmicb.2021.789062,

The results show that the concentration of nanoparticles has a significant impact on the stability of microbubbles, and loading an appropriate amount of nanoparticles is helpful in improving the stability of microbubbles.

doi:10.3389/fimmu.2022.961198,Fast-track development of vaccines for SARS-CoV-2: The shots that saved the world,"In December 2019, an outbreak emerged of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which leads to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The World Health Organisation announced the outbreak a global health emergency on 30 January 2020 and by 11 March 2020 it was declared a pandemic. The spread and severity of the outbreak took a heavy toll and overburdening of the global health system, particularly since there were no available drugs against SARS-CoV-2. With an immediate worldwide effort, communication, and sharing of data, large amounts of funding, researchers and pharmaceutical companies immediately fast-tracked vaccine development in order to prevent severe disease, hospitalizations and death. A number of vaccines were quickly approved for emergency use, and worldwide vaccination rollouts were immediately put in place. However, due to several individuals being hesitant to vaccinations and many poorer countries not having access to vaccines, multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants quickly emerged that were distinct from the original variant. Uncertainties related to the effectiveness of the various vaccines against the new variants as well as vaccine specific-side effects have remained a concern. Despite these uncertainties, fast-track vaccine approval, manufacturing at large scale, and the effective distribution of COVID-19 vaccines remain the topmost priorities around the world. Unprecedented efforts made by vaccine developers/researchers as well as healthcare staff, played a major role in distributing vaccine shots that provided protection and/or reduced disease severity, and deaths, even with the delta and omicron variants. Fortunately, even for those who become infected, vaccination appears to protect against major disease, hospitalisation, and fatality from COVID-19.

We analyzed 62 weeks of data from 19 sites participating in the North Carolina Wastewater Monitoring Network to characterize wastewater metrics before and around the Delta and Omicron surges. We found that, on average, wastewater data identified new outbreaks four to five days before case data (reported based on the earlier of the symptom start date or test collection date). At most sites, correlations between wastewater and case data were similar regardless of how wastewater concentrations were normalized, and correlations were slightly stronger with county-level cases than sewershed-level cases, suggesting that officials may not need to geospatially align case data with sewershed boundaries to gain insights into disease transmission. Wastewater trend lines showed clear differences in the Delta versus Omicron surge trajectories, but no single wastewater metric (detectability, percent change, or flow-population normalized viral concentrations) adequately indicated when these surges started. After iteratively examining different combinations of these three metrics, we developed a simple algorithm that identifies unprecedented signals in the wastewater to help clarify changes in communities' burden.

doi:10.3390/ijms242015086,Preliminary Evidence of the Differential Expression of Human Endogenous Retroviruses in Kawasaki Disease and SARS-CoV-2-Associated Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children,"Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a postinfectious sequela of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with some clinical features overlapping with Kawasaki disease (KD). Our research group and others have highlighted that the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 can trigger the activation of human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs), which in turn induces inflammatory and immune reactions, suggesting HERVs as contributing factors in COVID-19 immunopathology. With the aim to identify new factors involved in the processes underlying KD and MIS-C, we analysed the transcriptional levels of HERVs, HERV-related genes, and immune mediators in children during the acute and subacute phases compared with COVID-19 paediatric patients and healthy controls. The results showed higher levels of HERV-W, HERV-K, Syn-1, and ASCT-1/2 in KD, MIS-C, and COV patients, while higher levels of Syn-2 and MFSD2A were found only in MIS-C patients. Moreover, KD and MIS-C shared the dysregulation of several inflammatory and regulatory cytokines. Interestingly, in MIS-C patients, negative correlations have been found between HERV-W and IL-10 and between Syn-2 and IL-10, while positive correlations have been found between HERV-K and IL-10. In addition, HERV-W expression positively correlated with the C-reactive protein. This pilot study supports the role of HERVs in inflammatory diseases, suggesting their interplay with the immune system in this setting. The elevated expression of Syn-2 and MFSD2A seems to be a distinctive trait of MIS-C patients, allowing to distinguish them from KD ones. The understanding of pathological mechanisms can lead to the best available treatment for these two diseases, limiting complications and serious outcomes.",International Journal of Molecular Sciences,2023,secondary,doi:10.3390/ijms242015086,37894766,10606856,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/ijms242015086,

These variants have acquired mutations conferring phenotypes such as increased transmissibility or virulence, or causing diagnostic, therapeutic, or immune escape. Detection of Alpha and the majority of Omicron sublineages by PCR relied on the so-called S gene target failure due to the deletion of six nucleotides coding for amino acids 69–70 in the spike (S) protein. Detection of hallmark mutations in other variants present in samples relied on whole genome sequencing. However, whole genome sequencing as a diagnostic tool is still in its infancy due to geographic inequities in sequencing capabilities, higher cost compared to other molecular assays, longer turnaround time from sample to result, and technical challenges associated with producing complete genome sequences from samples that have low viral load and/or high background. Hence, there is a need for rapid genotyping assays. In order to rapidly generate information on the presence of a variant in a given sample, we have created a panel of four triplex RT-qPCR assays targeting 12 mutations to detect and differentiate all five variants of concern: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron. We also developed an expanded pentaplex assay that can reliably distinguish among the major sublineages (BA.1–BA.5) of Omicron. In silico, analytical and clinical testing of the variant panel indicate that the assays exhibit high sensitivity and specificity. This panel can help fulfill the need for rapid identification of variants in samples, leading to quick decision making with respect to public health measures, as well as treatment options for individuals.

Here we report a high resolution and comprehensive map of antibody recognition of the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD), which is the target of most neutralizing antibodies, using computational structural analysis. With a dataset of nonredundant experimentally determined antibody-RBD structures, we classified antibodies by RBD residue binding determinants using unsupervised clustering.

The present prospective observational study is addressed at exploring the potentialities of breath analysis in discrimination between patients with a documented previous history of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and, at the moment of the enrollment, exhibiting a negative nasopharyngeal swab and acquired immunity (post-COVID) and healthy subjects with no evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection (no-COVID). The main purpose is to understand if traces of metabolic alterations induced during the acute phase of the infection are still detectable after negativization, in the form of a characteristic volatile organic compound (VOC) pattern. An overall number of 60 volunteers aged between 25 and 70 years were enrolled in the study (post-COVID: n.30; no-COVID: n. 30), according to well-determined criteria. Breath and ambient air samples were collected by means of an automated sampling system (Mistral) and analyzed by thermal desorption-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (TD-GC/MS). Statistical tests (Wilcoxon/Kruskal–Wallis test) and multivariate data analysis (principal component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis) were performed on data sets. Among all compounds detected (76 VOCs in 90% of breath samples), 5 VOCs (1-propanol, isopropanol, 2-(2-butoxyethoxy)ethanol, propanal and 4-(1,1-dimethylpropyl)phenol) showed abundances in breath samples collected from post-COVID subjects significantly different with respect to those collected from no-COVID group (Wilcoxon/Kruskal–Wallis test, p-values <0.05). Although not completely satisfactory separation between the groups was obtained, variables showing significant differences between the two groups and higher loadings for PCA are recognized biomarkers of COVID-19, according to previous studies in literature. Therefore, based on the outcomes obtained, traces of metabolic alterations induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection are still detectable after negativization. This evidence raises questions about the eligibility of post-COVID subjects in observational studies addressed at the detection of COVID-19.

However, the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine boosters has not much been investigated in hemodialysis (HD) patients receiving oral antiviral agents. In this retrospective study involving 258 HD patients with COVID-19 receiving molnupiravir, we stratified the study cohort according to vaccination status and compared the baseline characteristics and risks of 30-day composite events (COVID-19-related acute care visits, hospitalization, or mortality) among groups. Our analysis demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine boosters markedly decreased the risk of composite events in HD patients (hazard ratio (95% confidence interval), 0.163 (0.063–0.423) for three vs. ≤ two doses of vaccination, p < 0.001; 0.309 (0.115–0.830) for four vs. ≤ two doses of vaccination, p = 0.020). The benefits of vaccine boosters were similar between patients receiving mRNA-based and protein-based boosters and between those with post-booster intervals of ≤ 120 and > 120 days.

However, most of the research on vaccine immunogenicity has been centered on characterizing the antibody response, with limited exploration into the persistence of spike-specific memory B cells. Here we monitored the durability of the memory B cell response up to 9 months post-vaccination, and characterized the trajectory of spike-specific B cell phenotypes in healthy individuals who received two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine. To profile the spike-specific B cell response, we applied the tSNE and Cytotree automated approaches. Spike-specific IgA+ and IgG+ plasmablasts and IgA+ activated cells were observed 7 days after the second dose and disappeared 3 months later, while subsets of spike-specific IgG+ resting memory B cells became predominant 9 months after vaccination, and they were capable of differentiating into spike-specific IgG secreting cells when restimulated in vitro. Other subsets of spike-specific B cells, such as IgM+ or unswitched IgM+IgD+ or IgG+ double negative/atypical cells, were also elicited by the BNT162b2 vaccine and persisted up to month 9. The analysis of circulating spike-specific IgG, IgA, and IgM was in line with the plasmablasts observed.

doi:10.1101/2022.02.12.480198,Improved structural variant discovery in hard-to-call regions using sample-specific string detection from accurate long reads,"Structural variants (SVs) account for a large amount of sequence variability across genomes and play an important role in human genomics and precision medicine. Despite intense efforts over the years, the discovery of SVs in individuals remains challenging due to the diploid and highly repetitive structure of the human genome, and by the presence of SVs that vastly exceed sequencing read lengths. However, the recent introduction of low-error long-read sequencing technologies such as PacBio HiFi may finally enable to overcome these barriers. Here we present SVDSS, a novel hybrid method for discovery of SVs from long-read sequencing technologies (e.g., PacBio HiFi) that combines and effectively leverages mapping-free, mapping-based and assembly-based methodologies for overall superior SV discovery performance. Our experiments on several human samples show that SVDSS outperforms state-of-the-art mapping-based methods for discovery of insertion and deletion SVs in PacBio HiFi reads and achieves significant improvements in calling SVs in repetitive regions of the genome.

Moreover, it is not well known to what extent potentially modifiable risk factors contribute to mortality risk. In this historical cohort study, we investigated the incidence and risk factors for 30-day mortality among hemodialysis patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection treated in the European Fresenius Medical Care NephroCare network using conventional and machine learning techniques. Methods We included adult hemodialysis patients with the first documented SARS-CoV-2 infection between February 1, 2020, and March 31, 2021, registered in the clinical database. The index date for the analysis was the first SARS-CoV-2 suspicion date. Patients were followed for up to 30 days until April 30, 2021. Demographics, comorbidities, and various modifiable risk factors, expressed as continuous parameters and as key performance indicators (KPIs), were considered to tap multiple dimensions including hemodynamic control, nutritional state, and mineral metabolism in the 6 months before the index date. We used logistic regression (LR) and XGBoost models to assess risk factors for 30-day mortality. Results We included 9,211 patients (age 65.4 ± 13.7 years, dialysis vintage 4.2 ± 3.7 years) eligible for the study. The 30-day mortality rate was 20.8%. In LR models, several potentially modifiable factors were associated with higher mortality: body mass index (BMI) 30–40 kg/m2 (OR: 1.28, CI: 1.10–1.50), single-pool Kt/V (OR off-target vs on-target: 1.19, CI: 1.02–1.38), overhydration (OR: 1.15, CI: 1.01–1.32), and both low (<2.5 mg/dl) and high (≥5.5 mg/dl) serum phosphate levels (OR: 1.52, CI: 1.07–2.16 and OR: 1.17, CI: 1.01–1.35). On-line hemodiafiltration was protective in the model using KPIs (OR: 0.86, CI: 0.76–0.97). SHapley Additive exPlanations analysis in XGBoost models shows a high influence on prediction for several modifiable factors as well, including inflammatory parameters, high BMI, and fluid overload. In both LR and XGBoost models, age, gender, and comorbidities were strongly associated with mortality. Conclusion Both conventional and machine learning techniques showed that KPIs and modifiable risk factors in different dimensions ascertained 6 months before the COVID-19 suspicion date were associated with 30-day COVID-19-related mortality. Our results suggest that adequate dialysis and achieving KPI targets remain of major importance during the COVID-19 pandemic as well.",Frontiers in Nephrology,2022,secondary,doi:10.3389/fneph.2022.907959,37674993,10479683,https://doi.org/doi:10.3389/fneph.2022.907959,

Various types of face masks have been developed for people in previous years. However, any of these face masks do not provide any effective means to provide feedback to users to wear them accurately. In this work, the authors present a sensorized adjustable strap for a face mask to ensure its accurate position on the face. This strap allows wearing a face mask comfortably without putting any pressure on the ears of a user.

Therefore, it is essential to identify patients who may be at risk of developing lung metastasis from rectal cancer. Methods In this study, we utilized eight machine-learning methods to create a model for predicting the risk of lung metastasis in patients with rectal cancer. Our cohort consisted of 27,180 rectal cancer patients selected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database between 2010 and 2017 for model development. Additionally, we validated our models using 1118 rectal cancer patients from a Chinese hospital to evaluate model performance and generalizability. We assessed our models’ performance using various metrics, including the area under the curve (AUC), the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPR), the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), decision curve analysis (DCA), and calibration curves. Finally, we applied the best model to develop a web-based calculator for predicting the risk of lung metastasis in patients with rectal cancer. Result Our study employed tenfold cross-validation to assess the performance of eight machine-learning models for predicting the risk of lung metastasis in patients with rectal cancer. The AUC values ranged from 0.73 to 0.96 in the training set, with the extreme gradient boosting (XGB) model achieving the highest AUC value of 0.96. Moreover, the XGB model obtained the best AUPR and MCC in the training set, reaching 0.98 and 0.88, respectively. We found that the XGB model demonstrated the best predictive power, achieving an AUC of 0.87, an AUPR of 0.60, an accuracy of 0.92, and a sensitivity of 0.93 in the internal test set. Furthermore, the XGB model was evaluated in the external test set and achieved an AUC of 0.91, an AUPR of 0.63, an accuracy of 0.93, a sensitivity of 0.92, and a specificity of 0.93. The XGB model obtained the highest MCC in the internal test set and external validation set, with 0.61 and 0.68, respectively. Based on the DCA and calibration curve analysis, the XGB model had better clinical decision-making ability and predictive power than the other seven models.

Understanding these differences is still an ongoing challenge, that can lead to new therapeutic strategies and avoid unfavorable outcomes. In this review, we discuss the different roles of T lymphocyte subsets and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) in the immune responses of adults and children. Lymphopenia can influence these responses and represent a good predictor for the outcome, as reported by most authors. The increased IFN-γ response exhibited by children could be the starting point for the activation of a broad response that leads to MIS-C, with a significantly higher risk than in adults, although a single IFN signature has not been identified.

doi:10.1021/acssensors.2c02655,Integrating Water Purification with Electrochemical Aptamer Sensing for Detecting SARS-CoV-2 in Wastewater,"Wastewater analysis of pathogens, particularly SARS-CoV-2, is instrumental in tracking and monitoring infectious diseases in a population. This method can be used to generate early warnings regarding the onset of an infectious disease and predict the associated infection trends. Currently, wastewater analysis of SARS-CoV-2 is almost exclusively performed using polymerase chain reaction for the amplification-based detection of viral RNA at centralized laboratories. Despite the development of several biosensing technologies offering point-of-care solutions for analyzing SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples, these remain elusive for wastewater analysis due to the low levels of the virus and the interference caused by the wastewater matrix. Herein, we integrate an aptamer-based electrochemical chip with a filtration, purification, and extraction (FPE) system for developing an alternate in-field solution for wastewater analysis. The sensing chip employs a dimeric aptamer, which is universally applicable to the wild-type, alpha, delta, and omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrate that the aptamer is stable in the wastewater matrix (diluted to 50%) and its binding affinity is not significantly impacted. The sensing chip demonstrates a limit of detection of 1000 copies/L (1 copy/mL), enabled by the amplification provided by the FPE system. This allows the integrated system to detect trace amounts of the virus in native wastewater and categorize the amount of contamination into trace (<10 copies/mL), medium (10–1000 copies/mL), or high (>1000 copies/mL) levels, providing a viable wastewater analysis solution for in-field use.",ACS Sensors,2023,secondary,doi:10.1021/acssensors.2c02655,36926840,10042147,https://doi.org/doi:10.1021/acssensors.2c02655,
doi:10.3390/microorganisms11051233,Multiplexed Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification Coupled with a Nucleic Acid-Based Lateral Flow Dipstick as a Rapid Diagnostic Method to Detect SARS-CoV-2,"Due to the high reproduction rate of COVID-19, it is important to identify and isolate infected patients at the early stages of infection. The limitations of current diagnostic methods are speed, cost, and accuracy. Furthermore, new viral variants have emerged with higher rates of infectivity and mortality, many with mutations at various primer binding sites, which may evade detection via conventional PCR kits. Therefore, a rapid method that is sensitive, specific, and cost-effective is needed for a point-of-care molecular test. Accordingly, we developed a rapid molecular SARS-CoV-2 detection kit with high specificity and sensitivity, RT-PCR, taking advantage of the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) technique. Four sets of six primers were designed based on conserved regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome: two outer, two inner and two loop primers. Using the optimized protocol, SARS-CoV-2 genes were detected as quickly as 10 min but were most sensitive at 30 min, detecting as little as 100 copies of template DNA. We then coupled the RT-LAMP with a lateral flow dipstick (LFD) for multiplex detection. The LFD could detect two genic amplifications on a single strip, making it suitable for multiplexed detection. The development of a multiplexed RT-LAMP-LFD reaction on crude VTM samples would be suitable for the point-of-care diagnosis of COVID-19 in diagnostic laboratories as well as in private homes.",Microorganisms,2023,secondary,doi:10.3390/microorganisms11051233,37317207,10223058,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/microorganisms11051233,

Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a rare inflammatory syndrome with multisystem involvement affecting children exposed to COVID-19. This condition is rarely reported in East Asia and was not detected in Singapore until 2021. We present 12 cases of MIS-C diagnosed in KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH) from October 2021 to December 2021.


METHOD
We conducted an observational study on cases fulfilling the Singapore Ministry of Health criteria for MIS-C from January 2020 to December 2021 in KKH. Medical records were reviewed to obtain information on clinical presentation, disease course, treatment received and outcomes.


RESULTS
In the 12 cases detected, the median age was 7.50 years (interquartile range 4.00-9.25); 8 were male. All patients had mucocutaneous symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease. Other commonly involved systems were: haematological (coagulopathy 100%, lymphopaenia 91.70% and thrombocytopaenia 75.00%), gastrointestinal (75.00%) and cardiovascular (83.30%). Six patients (50.00%) had shock and were admitted to the intensive care unit. The majority of patients received treatment within 2 days of hospitalisation with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and steroids. All survived; the majority had normal echocardiograms and no long-term organ sequelae at 6 months post-discharge.


CONCLUSION
MIS-C emerged in Singapore as the incidence of COVID-19 in the community increased in 2021. The clinical presentation of our patients is similar to earlier reports, with some significant differences from Kawasaki disease. Multidisciplinary management, timely diagnosis, and early initiation of treatment with IVIg and steroids likely contributed to comparatively good outcomes. Our cases highlight the need for continued awareness of MIS-C among physicians, and surveillance of its incidence, short- and long-term outcomes.","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",2022,secondary,doi:10.47102/annals-acadmedsg.202283,36453214,,https://doi.org/doi:10.47102/annals-acadmedsg.202283,
doi:10.3390/ijerph19095128,Molecular Diagnostic Tools Applied for Assessing Microbial Water Quality,"Microbial water quality is of vital importance for human, animal, and environmental health. Notably, pathogenically contaminated water can result in serious health problems, such as waterborne outbreaks, which have caused huge economic and social losses. In this context, the prompt detection of microbial contamination becomes essential to enable early warning and timely reaction with proper interventions. Recently, molecular diagnostics have been increasingly employed for the rapid and robust assessment of microbial water quality implicated by various microbial pollutants, e.g., waterborne pathogens and antibiotic-resistance genes (ARGs), imposing the most critical health threats to humans and the environment. Continuous technological advances have led to constant improvements and expansions of molecular methods, such as conventional end-point PCR, DNA microarray, real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), multiplex qPCR (mqPCR), loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), digital droplet PCR (ddPCR), and high-throughput next-generation DNA sequencing (HT-NGS). These state-of-the-art molecular approaches largely facilitate the surveillance of microbial water quality in diverse aquatic systems and wastewater. This review provides an up-to-date overview of the advancement of the key molecular tools frequently employed for microbial water quality assessment, with future perspectives on their applications.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,2022,secondary,doi:10.3390/ijerph19095128,35564522,9105083,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/ijerph19095128,

Obesity has emerged as a potential risk for IBD; however, the data in the literature are conflicting, and relevant studies in Brazil are limited. Here, we report body mass index profile (BMI) of patients with IBD treated at reference centers in three states of northeastern Brazil. Patients and Methods Observational descriptive study conducted from January 2021 through December 2021 in patient with IBD. Results Of 470 patients with IBD, 194 (41%) were classified as normal weight, 42 (9%) as underweight, 155 (33%) as overweight, and 79 (17%) as obese; CD patients were significantly more likely to be underweight than UC patients (p=0.031)Overweight patients were older (median age: 47 years) than normal-weight and underweight patients at diagnosis (38.5 and 35.5 years, respectively [p<0.0001]). IBD onset and diagnosis among overweight and obese individuals were associated with older age. More extensive disease behavior patterns predominated in UC, while forms associated with complications were prevalent in CD, irrespective of nutritional status. There was a higher frequency of compatible symptoms with axial joint inflammation among obese patients (p=0.005) and a lower frequency of compatible symptoms with peripheral joint inflammation in underweight patients (p=0.044) than in patients of normal weight. No significant difference in the frequency of different drug or surgical treatments was observed among the groups. Conclusion Despite the predominance of overweight and obesity in patients with IBD, no differences in the patterns of disease were seen between the overweight and normal-weight groups; however, obesity was associated with IBD onset in older adults and a higher frequency compatible symptom with axial joint inflammation. These data reinforce the importance of monitoring the nutritional status of IBD patients and the need for a multidisciplinary approach, as recommended in the current guidelines.",Clinical and Experimental Gastroenterology,2023,secondary,doi:10.2147/CEG.S436699,38023814,10656846,https://doi.org/doi:10.2147/CEG.S436699,

As an alternative, self-collection of saliva and gargle samples minimizes transmission to healthcare workers and relieves the pressure of resources and healthcare personnel during the pandemic. This study aimed to develop an enhanced method enabling simultaneous viral inactivation and RNA preservation during on-site self-collection of saliva and gargle samples. Our method involves the addition of saliva or gargle samples to a newly formulated viral inactivation and RNA preservation (VIP) buffer, concentration of the viral RNA on magnetic beads, and detection of SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction directly from the magnetic beads. This method has a limit of detection of 25 RNA copies per 200 μL of gargle or saliva sample and 9–111 times higher sensitivity than the viral RNA preparation kit recommended by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The integrated method was successfully used to analyze more than 200 gargle and saliva samples, including the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in 123 gargle and saliva samples collected daily from two NPS-confirmed positive SARS-CoV-2 patients throughout the course of their infection and recovery. The VIP buffer is stable at room temperature for at least 6 months. SARS-CoV-2 RNA (65 copies/200 μL sample) is stable in the VIP buffer at room temperature for at least 3 weeks.

While adults suffered the highest morbidity and mortality rates of coronavirus disease 2019, children were thought to be exclusively asymptomatic or to present with mild conditions. However, around April 2020, there was an outbreak of a new clinical syndrome related to SARS-CoV-2 in children - multisystemic inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) - which comprises a severe and uncon-trolled hyperinflammatory response with multiorgan involvement. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers a suspected case of MIS-C an individual aged < 21 years presenting with fever, high inflammatory markers levels, and evidence of clinically severe illness, with multisystem (> 2) organ involvement, no alternative plausible diagnoses, and positive for recent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Despite its severity, there are no definitive disease management guidelines for this condition. Conversely, the complex pathogenesis of MIS-C is still not completely understood, although it seems to rely upon immune dysregulation.

The aim of the study was to examine the effect of hyponatremia at admission as a negative prognostic factor in children hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia.


METHODS
The data of patients aged 1 month-18 years, who were followed with the diagnosis of pneumonia at Çanakkale Onsekiz Mart University Hospital, Department of Pediatrics, between January 2018 and May 2021 were examined, retrospectively. Patients (n=661) were divided into two main groups; COVID-19 pneumonia (n=158) and the other pneumonias [other viral pneumonia (n=161) and pneumonia of unknown etiology (n=342)].


RESULTS
Six hundred and twenty-three patients with a median (Q1-Q3) age of 4 (1.5-8) years, 59.4% of whom were male were included in the study. The overall prevalence of hyponatremia at admission was 11.2% and was lower in those with COVID-19 pneumonia than in those with other viral pneumonia (6.4% vs. 15.2%, p=0.013). When evaluated irrespective of their COVID-19 status, hyponatremic patients had a higher supplemental oxygen requirement (OR 2.5 [1.4-4.3], p < 0.001), higher need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission (OR 3.7 [1.3-10.2], p=0.009) and longer duration of hospitalization (p=0.016) than the normonatremic patients. In patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, being hyponatremic had no effect on supplemental oxygen requirements or the duration of hospitalization. When hyponatremic patients were evaluated, the supplemental oxygen requirements and duration of hospitalization of those with COVID-19 pneumonia were similar to the other pneumonias (p > 0.05 for all comparisons). However, normonatremic COVID-19 pneumonias had higher supplemental oxygen requirements than other viral pneumonias and pneumonia of unknown etiology (OR 4.7 [2.2-10.3], p < 0.001; OR 1.6 [1 -2.7], p=0.043, respectively).

The etiology of PCC remains uncertain. Examination of potential serological markers of PCC, accounting for clinical covariates, may yield emergent pathophysiological insights. Methods: In adherence to PRISMA guidelines, we carried out a rapid review of the literature. We searched Medline and Embase for primary observational studies that compared IgG response in individuals who experienced COVID-19 symptoms persisting [≥]12 weeks post-infection with those who did not. We examined relationships between serological markers and PCC status and investigated sources of inter-study variability, such as severity of acute illness, PCC symptoms assessed, and target antigen(s). Results: Of 8,018 unique records, we identified 29 as being eligible for inclusion in synthesis. Definitions of PCC varied. In studies that reported anti-nucleocapsid (N) IgG (n=10 studies; n=989 participants in aggregate), full or partial anti-Spike IgG (i.e., the whole trimer, S1 or S2 subgroups, or receptor binding domain, n=19 studies; n=2606 participants), or neutralizing response (n=7 studies; n=1123 participants), we did not find strong evidence to support any difference in serological markers between groups with and without persisting symptoms. However, most studies did not account for severity or level of care required during acute illness, and other potential confounders. Conclusions: Pooling of studies would enable more robust exploration of clinical and serological predictors among diverse populations.

Herein, we performed RNA sequencing using peripheral blood from acute and convalescent patients and interrogated the dynamic changes of adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection over time. Our results revealed numerous alterations in these cohorts in terms of gene expression profiles and the features of immune repertoire. Moreover, a machine learning method was developed and resulted in the identification of five independent biomarkers and a collection of biomarkers that could accurately differentiate and predict the development of COVID-19. Interestingly, the increased expression of one of these biomarkers, UCHL1, a molecule related to nervous system damage, was associated with the clustering of severe symptoms. Importantly, analyses on immune repertoire metrics revealed the distinct kinetics of T-cell and B-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, with B-cell response plateaued in the acute phase and declined thereafter, whereas T-cell response can be maintained for up to 6 months post-infection onset and T-cell clonality was positively correlated with the serum level of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Together, the significantly altered genes or biomarkers, as well as the abnormally high levels of B-cell response in acute infection, may contribute to the pathogenesis of COVID-19 through mediating inflammation and immune responses, whereas prolonged T-cell response in the convalescents might help these patients in preventing reinfection.

Methods: Blood samples were collected: before and 30 days after the first CoronaVac dose; 30, 90, and 180 days after the second CoronaVac dose, and also 20 days after the booster with the Pfizer vaccine. Results: Whilst the positivity to gamma interferon-type cellular response increased after the first CoronaVac dose, neutralizing and IgG antibody levels only raised 30 days after the second dose, followed by a drop in these responses after 90 and 180 days.

As expected, more cases of Campylobacter infection were diagnosed in the first period while more laboratory studies were performed in the second period (47.2% vs 14.9%), probably as a reflection of the fear of missing a possible diagnosis of MIS-C in the pandemic era. No cases showing both elevated C-reactive protein and profound lymphopenia were observed among the 74 children seen in the prepandemic period, while four (11.1% of the total cases and 30.6% of those in whom laboratory tests were performed) were found in the pandemic era. Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 exposure in the previous weeks was confirmed in three of these cases and infection was documented in one child, who was initially diagnosed as possible MIS-C and treated with intravenous gammaglobulin and corticosteroids for one day; treatment was suspended when the diagnosis of Campylobacter infection was confirmed. Clinical characteristics and laboratory findings of these four patients are shown in table 2. Our results raise the question of whether Campylobacter infection alone can be accountable for these laboratory findings and if a positive stool test can safely rule out a diagnosis of MIS-C or a short observation period in the hospital would be prudent, as children with MIS-C may develop additional organ system involvement over the course of admission [4].

Individual children's hospitals care for a small number of patients with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Administrative databases offer an opportunity to conduct generalizable research; however, identifying patients with MIS-C is challenging.


METHODS
We developed and validated algorithms to identify MIS-C hospitalizations in administrative databases. We developed 10 approaches using diagnostic codes and medication billing data and applied them to the Pediatric Health Information System from January 2020 to August 2021. We reviewed medical records at 7 geographically diverse hospitals to compare potential cases of MIS-C identified by algorithms to each participating hospital's list of patients with MIS-C (used for public health reporting).


RESULTS
The sites had 245 hospitalizations for MIS-C in 2020 and 358 additional MIS-C hospitalizations through August 2021. One algorithm for the identification of cases in 2020 had a sensitivity of 82%, a low false positive rate of 22%, and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 78%. For hospitalizations in 2021, the sensitivity of the MIS-C diagnosis code was 98% with 84% PPV.


CONCLUSION
We developed high-sensitivity algorithms to use for epidemiologic research and high-PPV algorithms for comparative effectiveness research. Accurate algorithms to identify MIS-C hospitalizations can facilitate important research for understanding this novel entity as it evolves during new waves.",Pediatrics,2023,secondary,doi:10.1542/peds.2022-059872,37102310,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1542/peds.2022-059872,

To be able to manage such pandemics in the future, it is necessary to develop proper strategies and opportunities to protect human life. The data on the SARS-CoV-2 virus must be continuously analyzed, and the possibilities of mutation and the emergence of new, more infectious variants must be anticipated, as well as the options of using different preventive and therapeutic techniques. This is because the fast development of severe acute coronavirus 2 syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern have posed a significant problem for COVID-19 pandemic control using the presently available vaccinations. This review summarizes data on the SARS-CoV-2 variants that are responsible for severe COVID-19 and the clinical efficacy of the most commonly used vaccines in clinical practice.

This new disease is a leading cause of hospital and paediatric intensive care unit (PICU). It has been related to immunity dysregulation. Methods Prospective-retrospective observational study to describe the innate cell signature and immunophenotype of children admitted to PICU because of PIMS-TS (from March 2020 to September 2020). The immunophenotype was done through the expression analysis of these proteins of mononuclear cells: CD64, CD18, CD11a and CD11b. They were compared with previous healthy controls and children admitted to PICU because of bacterial infection, viral infection and Kawasaki disease (KD). Two hundred and forty-seven children were studied: 183 healthy controls, 25 viral infections, 20 bacterial infections, 6 KD and 13 PIMS-TS. Results PIMT-TS showed the lowest percentage of lymphocytes and monocytes with higher relative numbers of CD4+ (p = .000). Monocytes and neutrophils in PIMS-TS showed higher levels of CD64 expression (p = .000). Also, CD11a and CD11b were highly expressed (p =,000). Conclusion We observed a differential cell innate signature in PIMS-TS.

doi:10.3390/v16010137,A Fulminant Case of Adenovirus Genotype C108 Infection in a Pediatric Stem Cell Transplant Recipient with x-Linked Lymphoproliferative Syndrome Type 1,"A 3-year-old male with X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome type 1 underwent an unrelated umbilical cord blood transplant (UUCBT). The week prior to transplant the patient tested positive for adenovirus (HAdV) with a viral load of <190 copies/mL and was started on cidofovir. UUCBT proceeded as scheduled, and the patient engrafted on day +19. The patient’s HAdV load in serum continued to rise with resulting hepatic dysfunction, despite ongoing therapy with cidofovir and HAdV specific T-cell infusions. The patient died 6 months after transplantation having never cleared the virus. Next generation whole genome sequencing and sequence data analyses identified an intertypic recombinant HAdV-C P1H2F2 closely related (99.6% similarity) to genotype C108 in the isolates from three blood specimens obtained during the last week of life. Incidentally, the de novo assembly strategy enabled the detection of an adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV2) genome in the DNA purified from the plasma isolates. Proteotyping analysis revealed minor differences in the predicted amino acid sequences for E1A, E1B 19K, E1B 55K, DNA polymerase, penton base, and fiber. None of the mutations previously described for HAdV-C5 variants resistant to cidofovir were identified.

It was first identified as a binder of cancer-associated chromosomal translocation breakpoint junctions leading to the suggestion that it was involved in genetic recombination. With a paralogous partner protein, Trax, Translin has subsequently been found to form a hetero-octomeric RNase complex that drives some of its functions, including passenger strand removal in RNA interference (RNAi). The Translin-Trax complex also degrades the precursors to tumour suppressing microRNAs in cancers deficient for the RNase III Dicer. This oncogenic activity has resulted in the Translin-Trax complex being explored as a therapeutic target. Additionally, Translin and Trax have been implicated in a wider range of biological functions ranging from sleep regulation to telomere transcript control. Here we reveal a Trax- and RNAi-independent function for Translin in dissociating RNA polymerase II from its genomic template, with loss of Translin function resulting in increased transcription-associated recombination and elevated genome instability. This provides genetic insight into the longstanding question of how Translin might influence chromosomal rearrangements in human genetic diseases and provides important functional understanding of an oncological therapeutic target.",PLoS Genetics,2022,secondary,doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1010267,35714159,9246224,https://doi.org/doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1010267,
doi:10.3390/vaccines9091002,"Pediatric COVID-19: Immunopathogenesis, Transmission and Prevention","Children are unique in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, SARS-CoV-2 has a lower medical impact in children as compared to adults. A higher proportion of children than adults remain asymptomatic following SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe disease and death are also less common. This relative resistance contrasts with the high susceptibility of children to other respiratory tract infections. The mechanisms involved remain incompletely understood but could include the rapid development of a robust innate immune response. On the other hand, children develop a unique and severe complication, named multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, several weeks after the onset of symptoms. Although children play an important role in the transmission of many pathogens, their contribution to the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 appears lower than that of adults. These unique aspects of COVID-19 in children must be considered in the benefit–risk analysis of vaccination.

In contrast, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) commonly presents with mucocutaneous manifestations. The presentation of SJS in a child with MIS-C deserves increased attention from clinicians because of its potential fatality. Here we describe a 10-year-old boy with a history of exposure to confirmed COVID-19 who presented with fever, bilateral subconjunctival hemorrhage, cracked and red lips, oral ulcers, and generalized hemorrhagic skin lesions with targetoid lesions. Laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis, neutrophilia, lymphopenia, elevated C-reactive protein, sedimentation rate, ferritin, and B-type natriuretic peptide. A skin biopsy revealed patchy vacuolar interface dermatitis with subepidermal edema and superficial and deep perivascular predominantly histiocytic infiltrates with scattered eosinophils, lymphocytes, and neutrophils suggestive of SJS.

A fundamental part of these surveillance programs is the variant tracking through sequencing approaches to monitor and identify new variants or mutations that may be of importance. Two of the main sequencing platforms are Illumina and Oxford Nanopore Technologies. Here, we compare the performance of MiSeq (Illumina) and MinION (Oxford Nanopore Technologies), as well as two different data processing pipelines, to determine the effect they may have on the results. MiSeq showed higher sequencing coverage, lower error rate, and better capacity to detect and accurately estimate variant abundances than MinION R9.4.1 flow cell data. The use of different variant callers (LoFreq and iVar) and approaches to calculate the variant proportions had a remarkable impact on the results generated from wastewater samples. Freyja, coupled with iVar, may be more sensitive and accurate than LoFreq, especially with MinION data, but it comes at the cost of having a higher error rate. The analysis of MinION R10.4.1 flow cell data using Freyja combined with iVar narrows the gap with MiSeq performance in terms of read quality, accuracy, sensitivity, and number of detected mutations. Although MiSeq should still be considered as the standard method for SARS-CoV-2 variant tracking, MinION’s versatility and rapid turnaround time may represent a clear advantage during the ongoing pandemic.",International Journal of Molecular Sciences,2023,secondary,doi:10.3390/ijms242417184,38139015,10743471,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/ijms242417184,

Moreover, the disorder is often difficult to manage. The range and role of microorganisms involved in the pathogenesis are currently not fully understood. Therefore, the condition has been studied using third-generation sequencing (Oxford Nanopore Technology) to gain a more complete picture of the pathogens involved. Throughout the metagenome assembly of a sample harvested from the ear canal of an 11-year-old female Yorkshire terrier suffering from chronic external otitis, a genome of Lawsonella clevelandensis was compiled.

doi:10.1126/scitranslmed.abj2266,Early sample tagging and pooling enables simultaneous SARS-CoV-2 detection and variant sequencing,"Description A sequencing-based detection and genotyping assay for SARS-CoV-2 is based on early sample pooling using barcoded oligo hybridization. Multiplexed SARS-CoV-2 sequencing Existing SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests use RNA extraction followed by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), which limit their ability to quantify and sequence multiple variants in a single test. Chappleboim et al. describe a multiplexed next-generation sequencing (NGS)–based method called ApharSeq in which samples are pooled early via hybridization of barcoded primers. This allows for hundreds of pooled samples to undergo multiplexed reverse transcription, PCR, and sequencing to detect and classify variant sequences with high sensitivity and negligible contamination. The ApharSeq method was validated on clinical samples, demonstrating that dozens of samples can be pooled early to markedly reduce costs while still providing per-sample variant information. Most severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) diagnostic tests have relied on RNA extraction followed by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays. Whereas automation improved logistics and different pooling strategies increased testing capacity, highly multiplexed next-generation sequencing (NGS) diagnostics remain a largely untapped resource. NGS tests have the potential to markedly increase throughput while providing crucial SARS-CoV-2 variant information. Current NGS-based detection and genotyping assays for SARS-CoV-2 are costly, mostly due to parallel sample processing through multiple steps. Here, we have established ApharSeq, in which samples are barcoded in the lysis buffer and pooled before reverse transcription. We validated this assay by applying ApharSeq to more than 500 clinical samples from the Clinical Virology Laboratory at Hadassah hospital in a robotic workflow. The assay was linear across five orders of magnitude, and the limit of detection was Ct 33 (~1000 copies/ml, 95% sensitivity) with >99.5% specificity. ApharSeq provided targeted high-confidence genotype information due to unique molecular identifiers incorporated into this method. Because of early pooling, we were able to estimate a 10- to 100-fold reduction in labor, automated liquid handling, and reagent requirements in high-throughput settings compared to current testing methods. The protocol can be tailored to assay other host or pathogen RNA targets simultaneously. These results suggest that ApharSeq can be a promising tool for current and future mass diagnostic challenges.",Science Translational Medicine,2021,secondary,doi:10.1126/scitranslmed.abj2266,34591660,9928115,https://doi.org/doi:10.1126/scitranslmed.abj2266,

The symmetrical shape of the homotrimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike protein presents the opportunity to create a matching homotrimeric molecular recognition element that is perfectly complementary to its structural scaffold, causing enhanced binding affinity. Here, we describe a branched homotrimeric aptamer with three-fold rotational symmetry, named TMSA52, that not only possesses excellent binding affinity but is also capable of binding several SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variants with picomolar affinity, as well as pseudotyped lentiviruses expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variants with femtomolar affinity. Using Pd–Ir nanocubes as nanozymes in an enzyme-linked aptamer binding assay (ELABA), TMSA52 was capable of sensitively detecting diverse pseudotyped lentiviruses in pooled human saliva with a limit of detection as low as 6.3 × 103 copies/mL. The ELABA was also used to test 50 SARS-CoV-2-positive and 60 SARS-CoV-2-negative patient saliva samples, providing sensitivity and specificity values of 84.0 and 98.3%, respectively, thus highlighting the potential of TMSA52 for the development of future rapid tests.",Journal of the American Chemical Society,2022,secondary,doi:10.1021/jacs.2c09870,36520671,9762500,https://doi.org/doi:10.1021/jacs.2c09870,

Quantitative estimation of the viral load of SARS‐CoV‐2 in patient samples could help physicians make decisions on clinical treatment and patient management. Here, we propose to use a quantitative LAMP (qLAMP) method to evaluate the viral load of SARS‐CoV‐2 in samples. We used threshold time (TT) values of qLAMP, the isothermal incubation time required for the fluorescent or colorimetric signal to reach the threshold, to indicate the viral load of clinical samples. Similar to the cycle threshold (Ct) values in conventional qPCR, TT values of qLAMP show a linear relationship to the copy numbers of SARS‐CoV‐2. The higher the viral loadings, the lower qLAMP TT values are. The RT‐qLAMP assay was demonstrated to quantify the viral loads of synthesized full‐length RNA, inactivated viral particles (BBIBP‐CorV), and clinical samples within 15 min by fluorescent reading and 25 min by colorimetric reading. The RT‐qLAMP has been applied to detect Alpha, Beta, Kappa, Delta, and Omicron variants of SARS‐CoV‐2, as well as the human beta‐actin gene, and their TT values showed the linear patterns. The RT‐qLAMP assays were evaluated by 64 clinical samples (25 positives and 39 negatives) for the assessment of viral loads, and it was also used to quantify the human beta‐actin gene, which was used as a control and an indicator of sampling quality in clinical swab samples.

Our article aims to explore the evolution of two rare cases of pediatric thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) with extremely similar clinical pictures, which, coincidentally, presented at approximately the same time in our hospital. These cases and our literature review demonstrate the multiple facets of thrombotic microangiopathy, which can produce various determinations and salient manifestations even among the pediatric population. TTP and aHUS may represent genuine diagnostic pitfalls through the overlap of their clinical and biological findings, although they develop through fundamentally different mechanisms that require different therapeutic approaches. As a novelty, we underline that COVID-19 infection cannot be excluded as potential trigger for TTP and aHUS in our patients and we predict that other reports of such an association will follow, raising a complex question of COVID-19’s implication in the occurrence and evolution of thrombotic microangiopathies. On this matter, we conducted literature research that resulted in 15 cases of COVID-19 pediatric infections associated with either TTP or aHUS. Taking into consideration the morbidity associated with TTP and aHUS, an elaborate differential diagnosis and prompt intervention are of the essence.",Diagnostics,2023,secondary,doi:10.3390/diagnostics13071228,37046448,10093431,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/diagnostics13071228,

The understanding of the molecular mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and evolution is a prerequisite to foresee the global trend of emerging vaccine-breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 variants and the design of mutation-proof vaccines and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). We integrate the genotyping of 1,489,884 SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from patients, a library collection of 130 human antibodies, tens of thousands of mutational data points, topological data analysis (TDA), and deep learning to reveal SARS-CoV-2 evolution mechanism and forecast emerging vaccine-escape variants. We show that infectivity-strengthening and antibody-disruptive co-mutations on the S protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) can quantitatively explain the infectivity and virulence of all prevailing variants. We demonstrate that Lambda is as infectious as Delta but is more vaccine-resistant. We analyze emerging vaccine-breakthrough co-mutations in 20 COVID-19 devastated countries, including the United Kingdom (UK), the United States (US), Denmark (DK), Brazil (BR), Germany (DE), Netherlands (NL), Sweden (SE), Italy (IT), Canada (CA), France (FR), India (IN), and Belgium (BE), etc. We envision that natural selection through infectivity will continue to be a main mechanism for viral evolution among unvaccinated populations, while antibody disruptive co-mutations will fuel the future growth of vaccine-breakthrough variants among fully vaccinated populations. Finally, we have identified the following sets of co-mutations that have the great likelihood of becoming dominant: [A411S, L452R, T478K], [L452R, T478K, N501Y], [V401L, L452R, T478K], [K417N, L452R, T478K], [L452R, T478K, E484K, N501Y], and [P384L, K417N, E484K, N501Y].

The frozen specimens can be easily transported and tested later. In addition, de-identified frozen remnant samples are resources for many preclinical or clinical studies. It is therefore crucial to understand whether freeze and thaw cycles (FTCs) can adversely affect SARS-CoV-2 test performance when frozen samples are tested. Some early studies suggest that the FTCs increased the cycles threshold (Ct) of RT-PCR indicating the potential degradation of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid after FTCs, while the others did not report any significant changes in the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids after the FTCs. Moreover, the impact of FTCs on the performance of the SARS-CoV-2 antigen test is scarcely reported. In this study, we performed paired nucleic acid and rapid antigen tests on the same samples to investigate and directly compare how FTCs affect the performance of two types of tests. Both inactivated viral culture fluid samples and clinical remnant samples were studied. Our results showed that FTCs had minimal negative effects on the performance of the rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen test, and the test results remained largely consistent throughout the FTCs, whereas the Ct values of RT-PCR increased with the increase of the FTC numbers. In addition, our data also demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 is preserved better in VTM than PBS during FTCs in regard to nucleic acid testing.",,2022,secondary,doi:10.1101/2022.12.14.22282041,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2022.12.14.22282041,

Variant diversity differed within parts of the New York City sewershed and between wastewater sludge and influent samples. P314L, D614G and T3255I occurred in >95% of wastewater samples. Enhanced infectivity, transmissibility and escape from antibody neutralization were dominant traits in the wastewater. Strikingly, over 60% of the most frequently occurring mutations were found in regions other than the spike (S) protein, and nearly 50% remain uncharacterized for functional impacts warranting further investigation. We demonstrate strong correlations between P314L, D614G, T95I, G50E, G50R, G204R, R203K, G662S, P10S, P13L and mortality rates, percent positive test results, hospitalization rates and % of population fully vaccinated. The results from our study suggest that there are relatively understudied mutations in the spike protein (H655Y, T95I) and understudied mutations occurring in non-spike proteins (N, ORF1b, ORF9b and ORF9c), that are enhancing transmissibility and infectivity among human populations, warranting further investigation.",,2022,secondary,doi:10.1101/2022.07.15.22277689,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2022.07.15.22277689,

Some bioinformatics tools have been developed for detecting or genotyping TRs. However, little study has been done to genotyping TR alleles from long-read sequencing data, and the accuracy of genotyping TR alleles from next-generation sequencing data still needs to be improved. Herein, a novel algorithm is described to retrieve TR regions from sequence alignment, and a software program TRcaller has been developed and integrated into a web portal to call TR alleles from both short- and long-read sequences, both whole genome and targeted sequences generated from multiple sequencing platforms. All TR alleles are genotyped as haplotypes and the robust alleles will be reported, even multiple alleles in a DNA mixture. TRcaller could provide substantially higher accuracy (>99% in 289 human individuals) in detecting TR alleles with magnitudes faster (e.g., ∼2 s for 300x human sequence data) than the mainstream software tools. The web portal preselected 119 TR loci from forensics, genealogy, and disease related TR loci. TRcaller is validated to be scalable in various applications, such as DNA forensics and disease diagnosis, which can be expanded into other fields like breeding programs.

doi:10.1002/cpz1.934,The MegaPool Approach to Characterize Adaptive CD4+ and CD8+ T Cell Responses,"Epitopes recognized by T cells are a collection of short peptide fragments derived from specific antigens or proteins. Immunological research to study T cell responses is hindered by the extreme degree of heterogeneity of epitope targets, which are usually derived from multiple antigens; within a given antigen, hundreds of different T cell epitopes can be recognized, differing from one individual to the next because T cell epitope recognition is restricted by the epitopes’ ability to bind to MHC molecules, which are extremely polymorphic in different individuals. Testing large pools encompassing hundreds of peptides is technically challenging because of logistical considerations regarding solvent‐induced toxicity. To address this issue, we developed the MegaPool (MP) approach based on sequential lyophilization of large numbers of peptides that can be used in a variety of assays to measure T cell responses, including ELISPOT, intracellular cytokine staining, and activation‐induced marker assays, and that has been validated in the study of infectious diseases, allergies, and autoimmunity. Here, we describe the procedures for generating and testing MPs, starting with peptide synthesis and lyophilization, as well as a step‐by‐step guide and recommendations for their handling and experimental usage. Overall, the MP approach is a powerful strategy for studying T cell responses and understanding the immune system's role in health and disease. © 2023 The Authors.

The differences of clinical characteristics between children with KD and children with IKD were compared. The risk factors of CAL were analyzed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Comparison of clinical characteristics between KD and IKD groups, the results showed there was significant difference in terms of conjunctival congestion, rash, lymph node enlargement, hand and foot redness, intravenous immune globulin non reaction and fever time (P < .05). Comparison of laboratory indicators between 2 groups, the results showed that there was significantly difference in the levels of neutrophils (P < .05). 15 cases (15.31%) in KD group were complicated with CAL, and 17 cases (41.46%) in IKD group were complicated with CAL, and the results showed there was a significant difference between the 2 groups (P < .05).

However, developing a practical on-site, end-to-end method for detection remains a challenge. In this study, we established protocols for on-site detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on surfaces using two portable laboratory devices: The PicoGene PCR1100 and Bento Lab. Test particles comprised of inactivated viral particles containing partial sequences of SARS-CoV-2, type 1 poliovirus, coxsackie virus A16, and norovirus genogroups I and II were applied to reference materials as simulated contaminants. The direct detection method with the PicoGene PCR1100 achieved a recovery efficiency of 35.1% for the dried reference material. Furthermore, the Bento Lab, equipped with a microcentrifuge for on-site RNA purification, successfully detected a low concentration of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 reference standard. The recovery efficiency of the on-site RNA purification method on plastic, stainless steel, glass, and polyvinyl chloride surfaces ranged from 15.5% to 21.2%. Through the combination of these portable devices, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected within 1 h of swab sampling. This study contributes to the on-site risk assessment of infectious diseases by enabling the rapid detection of viral genomes. IMPORTANCE This study presents the development of a highly sensitive on-site method for detecting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA on various surfaces, including doorknobs and tables. Identifying SARS-CoV-2 RNA on these surfaces can be crucial in guiding decision-making for implementing non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as zoning strategies, improving ventilation, maintaining physical distancing, and promoting increased hand hygiene practices. Moreover, the on-site detection system can facilitate the swift initiation of mitigation responses in non-laboratory settings, including long-term care facilities and schools. The protocols established in this study offer a comprehensive approach for achieving both sensitivity and rapidity in on-site SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection. Furthermore, since the RT-qPCR assay serves as the gold standard for detecting viral RNAs, the developed protocol holds potential for application to other viruses, including enteroviruses and noroviruses.

The Genome in a Bottle consortium generates variant benchmarks for DNA Reference Materials from seven human cell lines to reliably identify errors in comparison variant sets, as well as stratification files for error analysis in specific genomic regions. Current genome stratifications include discrete bins of homopolymer size, tandem repeat size, mappability, and segmental duplications focusing on regions subject to bias in sequencing technologies and/or variant calling methods. To move to a data-driven approach for genome stratification development and interrogation of variant calling errors, we developed a stratification model - StratoMod. StratoMod is built with an interpretable machine learning classifier, Explainable Boosting Machines (EBMs), to predict variant calling errors from features derived from genomic and sequencing data. EBMs quantify univariate effects and pairwise interactions, which facilitates understanding how each feature contributes to a prediction. Here, we describe the design, training, testing, and application of StratoMod, including demonstrating its ability to identify characteristics of sequencing reads and repetitive genome regions that are likely to generate variant calling errors. Specifically, StratoMod identified distinct associations with errors for A/T vs. G/C homopolymer lengths, and quantified sources of error for a new sequencing technology. We also demonstrated that the model could predict clinically-relevant variants that may be missed by certain methods, using DeepVariant calls from Illumina as an example. For this example, we produced a resource of difficult-to-map genes with challenging variants and large challenging INDELs. Using this model with GIAB benchmarks facilitates a deeper quantitative understanding of sources of variant calling errors from a wide variety of methods.",bioRxiv,2023,secondary,doi:10.1101/2023.01.20.524401,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2023.01.20.524401,

The biosensor employs a stapled hACE-2 N-terminal alpha helix peptide to functionalize an in-situ grown polypyrrole conductive polymer on a nitrocellulose membrane backbone through a chemical process. We assessed the biosensor’s analytical performance using heat-inactivated omicron and delta variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in artificial saliva (AS) and nasal swabs (NS) samples diluted in a strong ionic solution. Virus identification was achieved through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and frequency analyses. The assay demonstrated a limit of detection of 40 TCID50/mL, with 95% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Notably, the biosensor exhibited no cross-reactivity when tested against the influenza virus. The entire testing process using the biosensor takes less than a minute. In summary, our biosensor exhibits promising potential in the battle against pandemic respiratory viruses, offering a platform for the creation of rapid, compact, portable, and point-of-care devices capable of multiplexing various viruses. This groundbreaking development has the capacity to significantly bolster our readiness and response to future viral outbreaks.","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,secondary,doi:10.3390/s23188000,37766054,10534802,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/s23188000,

The virus caused the disease called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Over 4 million deaths blame COVID-19 during the last one year and 8 months in the world. Currently, four SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern are mainly focused by pandemic studies with limited experiments to translate the infectivity and pathogenicity of each variant. The SARS-CoV-2 α, β, γ, and δ variant of concern was originated from United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil/Japan, and India, respectively. The classification of SARS-CoV-2 variant is based on the mutation in spike (S) gene on the envelop of SARS-CoV-2. This review describes four SARS-CoV-2 α, β, γ, and δ variants of concern including SARS-CoV-2 ε, ζ, η, ι, κ, and B.1.617.3 variants of interest and alert. Recently, SARS-CoV-2 δ variant prevails over different countries that have 3 unique mutation sites: E156del/R158G in the N-terminal domain and T478K in a crucial receptor binding domain.

However, the emergence of viral variants that are more infectious than the earlier SARS-CoV-2 strains is concerning. Several of these viral variants have the potential to partially escape neutralizing antibody responses warranting continued immune-monitoring. Here, we tested a number of currently circulating viral variants of concern/interest, including B.1.526 (Iota), B.1.1.7+E484K (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), B.1.617.2 (Delta) and C.37 (Lambda) in neutralization assays using a panel of post-mRNA vaccination sera. The assays were performed with authentic SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolates in an assay that mimics physiological conditions. We found only small decreases in neutralization against B.1.526 and an intermediate phenotype for B.617.2. The reduction was stronger against a sub-variant of C.37, followed by B.1.351 and B.1.1.7+E484K. C.37 is currently circulating in parts of Latin America and was detected in Germany, the US and Israel. Of note, reduction in a binding assay that also included P.1, B.1.617.1 (Kappa) and A.23.1 was negligible.

doi:10.1093/clinchem/hvac113,Clinical Validation of Genome Reference Consortium Human Build 38 in a Laboratory Utilizing Next-Generation Sequencing Technologies.,"BACKGROUND
Laboratories utilizing next-generation sequencing align sequence data to a standardized human reference genome (HRG). Several updated versions, or builds, have been released since the original HRG in 2001, including the Genome Reference Consortium Human Build 38 (GRCh38) in 2013. However, most clinical laboratories still use GRCh37, which was released in 2009. We report our laboratory's clinical validation of GRCh38.


METHODS
Migration to GRCh38 was validated by comparing the coordinates (lifting over) of 9443 internally curated variants from GRCh37 to GRCh38, globally comparing protein coding sequence variants aligned with GRCh37 vs GRCh38 from 917 exomes, assessing genes with known discrepancies, comparing coverage differences, and establishing the analytic sensitivity and specificity of variant detection using Genome in a Bottle data.


RESULTS
Eight discrepancies, due to strand swap or reference base, were observed. Three clinically relevant variants had the GRCh37 alternate allele as the reference allele in GRCh38. A comparison of 88 295 calls between builds identified 8 disease-associated genes with sequence differences: ABO, BNC2, KIZ, NEFL, NR2E3, PTPRQ, SHANK2, and SRD5A2. Discrepancies in coding regions in GRCh37 were resolved in GRCh38.


CONCLUSIONS
There were a small number of clinically significant changes between the 2 genome builds. GRCh38 provided improved detection of nucleotide changes due to the resolution of discrepancies present in GRCh37. Implementation of GRCh38 results in more accurate and consistent reporting.",Clinical chemistry,2022,secondary,doi:10.1093/clinchem/hvac113,35869940,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1093/clinchem/hvac113,

doi:10.1002/jmv.28890,Looking back on the outbreak of acute severe hepatitis with unknown etiology in children in 2022: What do we know now and where do we go from here?,"An outbreak of acute severe hepatitis with unidentified etiology in children, which had been reported in 35 countries during March 2022 to September 2022, had aroused extensive public concern. The clinical manifestation of those pediatric patients was featured by elevated serum transaminases >500 IU/L, with exclusion of common A−E viral hepatitis. Previous reports had linked the unexplained hepatitis to a primary human adenovirus (HAdV) infection based on the high detection positivity of HAdV in patients' blood and stool samples, especially HAdV‐F41, while some other hypotheses centered around previous infections of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2). However, the etiological link between the pediatric hepatitis and HAdV or coronavirus has not been established. Recently, three independent research groups have found compelling evidence supporting the pathogenesis of an unexpected adeno‐associated virus‐2 (AAV‐2) infection. AAV is a non‐enveloped, helper‐dependent, single‐stranded DNA virus from the Parvoviridae family. To date, at least 13 natural serotypes of AAV have been identified. Given the low immunogenicity and broad tissue tropism of AAV vectors, engineered AAV has been widely used as gene delivery vehicle for both proliferating and non‐proliferating cells. Liver is the main infection site of AAV and the link between liver‐associated diseases and AAV‐2 infection was reported earlier by introducing the underlying oncogenic effects of AAV‐2 integration, yet the conclusion remains controversial. Otherwise, few known diseases had been demonstrated to be associated with AAV infection, despite the high serological prevalence of AAV‐2 (30%−60%) and other AAV serotypes in adults. Therefore, although AAV‐2 had been detected in pediatric hepatitis patients with quantity far exceeding HAdV and SARS‐CoV‐2, using metagenomic sequencing according to earlier versions of the UK Health Security Agency reports, AAV‐2 infection has been scarcely suspected as a culprit until recently. Consistent with a widely recognized viral characteristic that AAV‐2 infection is not cytopathogenic, Morfopoulou et al. reported that no viral inclusions or direct viral cytopathic effect was observed in the pediatric patients' hepatocytes. Along with the observation of infiltrated activated T lymphocytes around AAV‐2 infected hepatocytes and the evidenced increase of T‐cell‐response‐associated cytokines, these data provisionally support a notion that immune‐ mediated pathogenesis constitutes the primary cause of liver injury in children. It is noteworthy that either HAdV, human herpesvirus 6 (HHV‐6), or Epstein−Barr virus was also tested positive in most cases, most probably as helper virus enabling AAV‐2 replication. Theoretically, assuming that helper viruses are absent, AAV‐2 per se could hardly induce liver damage severe enough to require liver transplantation, as input virions could only infect a very small portion of hepatocytes and therefore elicited limited immune responses. Nevertheless, the direct cytopathogenicity of AAV‐2 in hepatocytes as well as other tissue cells should be further evaluated, as another study by Ho et al. reported that viral inclusions existed in one certain patient's liver biopsy sample. Despite the high seroprevalence of AAV‐2 and other AAVs in human beings, the pathogenesis of host immune response against AAV infection is seldom reported, indicating either a low immunogenicity of AAV or a mildness of both innate and adaptive immunity elicited by the virus. Several plausible explanations for the contradiction between the severity of acute hepatitis in children and the viral characteristics of AAV‐2 might be, but not limited to: (1) Given the",Journal of Medical Virology,2023,secondary,doi:10.1002/jmv.28890,37334975,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1002/jmv.28890,

The emergence and epidemiological dominance of SARS-CoV-2 mutants with high transmission potential and immune evasion properties, the so-called variants of concern (VOC), continue to be a major concern. ABSTRACT Emergence of SARS-CoV-2 with high transmission and immune evasion potential, the so-called variants of concern (VOC), is a major concern. We describe the early genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 recovered from vaccinated health care professionals (HCP). Our postvaccination COVID-19 symptoms-based surveillance program among HCPs in a 17-hospital network identified all vaccinated HCPs who tested positive for COVID-19 after routine screening or after self-reporting. From 1 January 2021 to 30 April 2021, 23,687 HCPs received either mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. All available postvaccination SARS-CoV-2 samples and a random collection from nonvaccinated patients during the similar time frame were subjected to VOC screening and whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Sixty-two percent (23,697/37,500) of HCPs received at least one vaccine dose, with 60% (22,458) fully vaccinated. We detected 138 (0.58%, 138/23,697) COVID-19 cases, 105 among partially vaccinated and 33 (0.15%, 33/22,458) among fully vaccinated. Five partially vaccinated required hospitalization, four with supplemental oxygen. VOC screening from 16 fully vaccinated HCPs identified 6 (38%) harboring N501Y and 1 (6%) with E484K polymorphisms; percentage of concurrent nonvaccinated samples was 37% (523/1,404) and 20% (284/1,394), respectively. There was an upward trend from January to April for E484K/Q (3% to 26%) and N501Y (1% to 49%). WGS analysis from vaccinated and nonvaccinated individuals indicated highly congruent phylogenies. We did not detect an increased frequency of any receptor-binding domain (RBD)/N-terminal domain (NTD) polymorphism between groups (P > 0.05). Our results support robust protection by vaccination, particularly among recipients of both doses. Despite VOCs accounting for over 40% of SARS-CoV-2 from fully vaccinated individuals, the genomic diversity appears to proportionally represent VOCs among nonvaccinated populations. IMPORTANCE A number of highly effective vaccines have been developed and deployed to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The emergence and epidemiological dominance of SARS-CoV-2 mutants with high transmission potential and immune evasion properties, the so-called variants of concern (VOC), continue to be a major concern. Whether these VOCs alter the efficacy of the administered vaccines is of great concern and a critical question to study. We describe the initial genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 recovered from partial/fully vaccinated health care professionals and probe specifically for VOC enrichment. Our findings support the high level of protection provided by full vaccination despite a steep increase in the prevalence of polymorphisms associated with increased transmission potential (N501Y) and immune evasion (E484K) in the nonvaccinated population. Thus, we do not find evidence of VOC enrichment among vaccinated groups. Overall, the genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 recovered postvaccination appears to proportionally represent the observed viral diversity within the community.",Microbiology Spectrum,2021,secondary,doi:10.1128/Spectrum.01882-21,34787439,8597639,https://doi.org/doi:10.1128/Spectrum.01882-21,

doi:10.1093/bib/bbad188,Comparison and benchmark of structural variants detected from long read and long-read assembly,"Structural variant (SV) detection is essential for genomic studies, and long-read sequencing technologies have advanced our capacity to detect SVs directly from read or de novo assembly, also known as read-based and assembly-based strategy. However, to date, no independent studies have compared and benchmarked the two strategies. Here, on the basis of SVs detected by 20 read-based and eight assembly-based detection pipelines from six datasets of HG002 genome, we investigated the factors that influence the two strategies and assessed their performance with well-curated SVs. We found that up to 80% of the SVs could be detected by both strategies among different long-read datasets, whereas variant type, size, and breakpoint detected by read-based strategy were greatly affected by aligners. For the high-confident insertions and deletions at non-tandem repeat regions, a remarkable subset of them (82% in assembly-based calls and 93% in read-based calls), accounting for around 4000 SVs, could be captured by both reads and assemblies. However, discordance between two strategies was largely caused by complex SVs and inversions, which resulted from inconsistent alignment of reads and assemblies at these loci. Finally, benchmarking with SVs at medically relevant genes, the recall of read-based strategy reached 77% on 5X coverage data, whereas assembly-based strategy required 20X coverage data to achieve similar performance. Therefore, integrating SVs from read and assembly is suggested for general-purpose detection because of inconsistently detected complex SVs and inversions, whereas assembly-based strategy is optional for applications with limited resources.",Briefings in bioinformatics,2023,secondary,doi:10.1093/bib/bbad188,37200087,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1093/bib/bbad188,

Despite extensive investigation of the natural environmental microbiome, no comprehensive profile of microbial ecology has been reported in malls. Characterizing microbial distribution, potential pathogens, and antimicrobial resistance will enhance our understanding of how these microbial communities are formed, maintained, and transferred and help establish a baseline for biosurveillance of potential public health threats in malls. ABSTRACT Shopping malls offer various niches for microbial populations, potentially serving as sources and reservoirs for the spread of microorganisms of public health concern. However, knowledge about the microbiome and the distribution of human pathogens in malls is largely unknown. Here, we examine the microbial community dynamics and genotypes of potential pathogens from floor and escalator surfaces in shopping malls and adjacent road dusts and greenbelt soils. The distribution pattern of microbial communities is driven primarily by habitats and seasons. A significant enrichment of human-associated microbiota in the indoor environment indicates that human interactions with surfaces might be another strong driver for mall microbiomes. Neutral community models suggest that the microbial community assembly is strongly driven by stochastic processes. Distinct performances of microbial taxonomic signatures for environmental classifications indicate the consistent differences of microbial communities of different seasons/habitats and the strong anthropogenic effect on homogenizing microbial communities of shopping malls. Indoor environments harbored higher concentrations of human pathogens than outdoor samples, also carrying a high proportion of antimicrobial resistance-associated multidrug efflux genes and virulence genes. These findings enhanced the understanding of the microbiome in the built environment and the interactions between humans and the built environment, providing a basis for tracking biothreats and communicable diseases and developing sophisticated early warning systems. IMPORTANCE Shopping malls are distinct microbial environments which can facilitate a constant transmission of microorganisms of public health concern between humans and the built environment or between human and human.

The variant has mutations in its spike protein that might allow it to escape neutralization by vaccine-elicited antibodies and might cause monoclonal antibody therapy for COVID-19 to be less successful. ABSTRACT DNA sequence analysis recently identified the novel SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.526 that is spreading at an alarming rate in the New York City area. Two versions of the variant were identified, both with the prevalent D614G mutation in the spike protein, together with four novel point mutations and with an E484K or S477N mutation in the receptor-binding domain, raising concerns of possible resistance to vaccine-elicited and therapeutic antibodies. We report that convalescent-phase sera and vaccine-elicited antibodies retain full neutralizing titer against the S477N B.1.526 variant and neutralize the E484K version with a modest 3.5-fold decrease in titer compared to D614G. The E484K version was neutralized with a 12-fold decrease in titer by the REGN10933 monoclonal antibody, but the combination cocktail with REGN10987 was fully active. The findings suggest that current vaccines and Regeneron therapeutic monoclonal antibodies will remain protective against the B.1.526 variants.

doi:10.1097/CCE.0000000000000800,Validating a Proteomic Signature of Severe COVID-19,"OBJECTIVES: COVID-19 is a heterogenous disease. Biomarker-based approaches may identify patients at risk for severe disease, who may be more likely to benefit from specific therapies. Our objective was to identify and validate a plasma protein signature for severe COVID-19. DESIGN: Prospective observational cohort study. SETTING: Two hospitals in the United States. PATIENTS: One hundred sixty-seven hospitalized adults with COVID-19. INTERVENTION: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We measured 713 plasma proteins in 167 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 using a high-throughput platform. We classified patients as nonsevere versus severe COVID-19, defined as the need for high-flow nasal cannula, mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or death, at study entry and in 7-day intervals thereafter. We compared proteins measured at baseline between these two groups by logistic regression adjusting for age, sex, symptom duration, and comorbidities. We used lead proteins from dysregulated pathways as inputs for elastic net logistic regression to identify a parsimonious signature of severe disease and validated this signature in an external COVID-19 dataset. We tested whether the association between corticosteroid use and mortality varied by protein signature. One hundred ninety-four proteins were associated with severe COVID-19 at the time of hospital admission. Pathway analysis identified multiple pathways associated with inflammatory response and tissue repair programs. Elastic net logistic regression yielded a 14-protein signature that discriminated 90-day mortality in an external cohort with an area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.88–0.95).

Variants are divided into three classes: variant of interest, variant of concern, and variant of high consequence depending on its impact on the transmission, disease severity, diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics. The variants of concern include the United Kingdom variant (B.1.1.7), South Africa variant (B.1.351), two related California variants (B.1.427 and B.1.429), and Brazil variant (P.1). These SARS-CoV-2 variants have a direct impact on the available COVID-19 vaccines and immunotherapeutics as they can alter the neutralizing activity of vaccine-elicited antibodies and monoclonal antibodies resulting in mild-to-substantial loss of efficacy. There is a need to establish surveillance systems that can monitor the emergence of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants worldwide.",Human Vaccines & Immunotherapeutics,2021,secondary,doi:10.1080/21645515.2021.1923350,34161189,8240541,https://doi.org/doi:10.1080/21645515.2021.1923350,

The cause of MIS-C is dysregulated innate immune response and a subsequent cytokine storm that results in endothelial damage. It has been determined that low levels of serum 25(OH)D increase the risk of developing immune-related diseases and disorders. Methods: To determine the incidence of hypovitaminosis D, and a possible correlation between 25(OH)D levels and the clinical severity of MIS-C, 21 patients hospitalized in the University Hospital of Split due to MIS-C were evaluated. Results: Hypovitaminosis D was detected in 95% of MIS-C patients. We found a significant relationship between the severity of MIS-C and 25(OH)D levels, as patients with more severe MIS-C had lower 25(OH)D. MIS-C patients with lower vitamin D levels had worse systolic and diastolic function of the left ventricle according to echocardiograms. There was no relationship between 25(OH)D levels and the tested laboratory inflammatory and cardiac markers. Conclusion: Hypovitaminosis D is very common in children with MIS-C and influences the severity of the disease.

doi:10.26434/chemrxiv-2021-g0k1t,Ratiometric Flapping Force Probe That Works in Polymer Gels.,"Polymer gels have recently attracted attention for their application in flexible devices, where mechanically robust gels are required. While there are many strategies to produce tough gels by suppressing nanoscale stress concentration on specific polymer chains, it is still challenging to directly verify the toughening mechanism at the molecular level. To solve this problem, the use of the flapping molecular force probe (FLAP) is promising because it can evaluate the nanoscale forces transmitted in the polymer chain network by ratiometric analysis of a stress-dependent dual fluorescence. A flexible conformational change of FLAP enables real-time and reversible responses to the nanoscale forces at the low force threshold, which is suitable for quantifying the percentage of the stressed polymer chains before structural damage. However, the previously reported FLAP only showed a negligible response in solvated environments because undesirable spontaneous planarization occurs in the excited state, even without mechanical force. Here, we have developed a new ratiometric force probe that functions in common organogels. Replacement of the anthraceneimide units in the flapping wings with pyreneimide units largely suppresses the excited-state planarization, leading to the force probe function under wet conditions. The FLAP-doped polyurethane organogel reversibly shows a dual-fluorescence response under sub-MPa compression. Moreover, the structurally modified FLAP is also advantageous in the wide dynamic range of its fluorescence response in solvent-free elastomers, enabling clearer ratiometric fluorescence imaging of the molecular-level stress concentration during crack growth in a stretched polyurethane film.",Journal of the American Chemical Society,2021,secondary,doi:10.26434/chemrxiv-2021-g0k1t,35108003,,https://doi.org/doi:10.26434/chemrxiv-2021-g0k1t,

doi:10.1093/ibd/izad111,Visceral Adiposity Independently Predicts Time to Flare in Inflammatory Bowel Disease but Body Mass Index Does Not.,"BACKGROUND
Obesity is associated with progression of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Visceral adiposity may be a more meaningful measure of obesity compared with traditional measures such as body mass index (BMI). This study compared visceral adiposity vs BMI as predictors of time to IBD flare among patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.


METHODS
This was a retrospective cohort study. IBD patients were included if they had a colonoscopy and computed tomography (CT) scan within a 30-day window of an IBD flare. They were followed for 6 months or until their next flare. The primary exposure was the ratio of visceral adipose tissue to subcutaneous adipose tissue (VAT:SAT) obtained from CT imaging. BMI was calculated at the time of index CT scan.


RESULTS
A total of 100 Crohn's disease and 100 ulcerative colitis patients were included. The median age was 43 (interquartile range, 31-58) years, 39% had disease duration of 10 years or more, and 14% had severe disease activity on endoscopic examination. Overall, 23% of the cohort flared with median time to flare 90 (interquartile range, 67-117) days. Higher VAT:SAT was associated with shorter time to IBD flare (hazard ratio of 4.8 for VAT:SAT ≥1.0 vs VAT:SAT ratio <1.0), whereas higher BMI was not associated with shorter time to flare (hazard ratio of 0.73 for BMI ≥25 kg/m2 vs BMI <25 kg/m2). The relationship between increased VAT:SAT and shorter time to flare appeared stronger for Crohn's than for ulcerative colitis.


CONCLUSIONS
Visceral adiposity was associated with decreased time to IBD flare, but BMI was not. Future studies could test whether interventions that decrease visceral adiposity will improve IBD disease activity.",Inflammatory bowel diseases,2023,secondary,doi:10.1093/ibd/izad111,37307420,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1093/ibd/izad111,

Immunopathogenesis drives severe outcomes in adults, and it is likely that age‐related differences in both the innate and specific immune responses underlie much of the variation. Understanding the protective features of the paediatric immune system may be crucial to better elucidate disease severity in adult COVID‐19 and may pave the way for novel therapeutic approaches. However, as well as uncommon cases of severe paediatric acute COVID‐19, there have been children who have presented with delayed multisystem inflammation, including cardiac, gastrointestinal, skin, mucosa and central nervous system involvement. The occurrence of coronary artery aneurysms has drawn comparisons with Kawasaki Disease, but similarities with the inflammatory phase of adult acute COVID‐19 have also been drawn. In this review, we summarise findings from studies investigating pre‐existing immunity, cytokine profiles, innate, B‐cell, antibody, T‐cell and vaccine responses in children with acute COVID‐19 and multisystem inflammation, compared with COVID‐19 adults and controls.

doi:10.1126/sciadv.abm0300,Epidemiological characteristics of the B.1.526 SARS-CoV-2 variant,"Background: The B.1.526 variant (WHO designation: Iota) is a SARS-CoV-2 variant of interest, as classified by both the US CDC and the WHO. Due to a lack of extensive genomic sequencing and contact tracing data, its key epidemiological properties have not been well characterized. Methods: We utilized nine epidemiological and population datasets collected in New York City (NYC), where B.1.526 emerged, and comprehensive modeling to estimate the changes in transmissibility, immune escape potential, and infection fatality risk (IFR) for B.1.526. Findings: Estimated transmission rate in the neighborhood where B.1.526 was initially detected was consistently higher than other neighborhoods in NYC and further increased during the weeks preceding B.1.526 detection, likely due to its early spread there. Overall, models estimated that B.1.526 had transmissibility about 15-25% higher than previously circulating variants and that it could escape immunity in 0-10% of previously infected persons. In addition, B.1.526 substantially increased IFR in older adults: by 46% (95% CI: 7.4 - 84%) among 45-64 year-olds, 82% (95% CI: 20 - 140%) among 65-74 year-olds, and 62% (95% CI: 45 - 80%) among 75+ during Nov 2020 - Apr 2021, compared to baseline IFR estimated for preexisting variants. Interpretation: New variants like B.1.526 likely spread in the population weeks prior to detection, and partial immune escape (e.g., resistance to therapeutic antibodies) could offset prior medical advances and increase IFR.

In this study, we demonstrate that monitoring pharmaceutical residues in untreated sewage provides complementary information that correlates with future occurrences of viral outbreaks. We monitored 63 pharmaceutically active compounds, including antivirals used to treat COVID-19 and influenza and over-the-counter drugs commonly used to relieve the symptoms of infection. Weekly sampling was conducted at four municipal sewage treatment plants in Western New York. Residues of drugs associated with managing COVID-19 symptoms were detected, including azithromycin (1.99-5.00 μg/L), chloroquine (0.01-33.00 μg/L), hydroxychloroquine (0.05-30.54 μg/L), and lopinavir (13.75-181.20 μg/L). A significant correlation (p < 0.001) was observed between the total COVID-19-related drugs detected and the 5-day rolling averages of reported cases. Acetaminophen concentrations spiked approximately 2.5 weeks before a spike in SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies in all wastewater treatment plants sampled.

However, due to the great variability in published results regarding COVID-19-induced chemosensory impairments and their follow-up, prognosis for chemosensory functions in patients with such complaints remains unclear. Our objective is to describe the various chemosensory alterations associated with COVID-19 and their prevalence and evolution after infection. A cross-sectional study of 704 healthcare workers with a RT–PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between 2020 February 28 and 2020 June 14 was conducted 3–7 months after onset of symptoms. Data were collected with an online questionnaire. Outcomes included differences in reported chemosensory self-assessment of olfactory, gustatory, and trigeminal functions across time points and Chemosensory Perception Test scores from an easy-to-use at-home self-administered chemosensory test. Among the 704 participants, 593 (84.2%) were women, the mean (SD) age was 42 (12) years, and the questionnaire was answered on average 4.8 (0.8) months after COVID-19. During COVID-19, a decrease in olfactory, gustatory, and trigeminal sensitivities was reported by 81.3%, 81.5%, and 48.0%, respectively. Three to 7 months later, reduced sensitivity was still reported by 52.0%, 41.9%, and 23.3%, respectively. Chemosensory Perception Test scores indicate that 19.5% of participants had objective olfactory impairment. These data suggest a significant proportion of COVID-19 cases have persistent chemosensory impairments at 3–7 months after their infection, but the majority of those who had completely lost their olfactory, gustatory, and trigeminal sensitivities have improved.",Chemical Senses,2021,secondary,doi:10.1093/chemse/bjab038,34423831,8499810,https://doi.org/doi:10.1093/chemse/bjab038,

doi:10.1101/2023.10.23.563576,OMEinfo: Global Geographic Metadata for -omics Experiments,"Microbiome studies increasingly associate geographical features like rurality and climate types with microbiomes. However, microbiologists/bioinformaticians often struggle to access and integrate rich geographical metadata from sources such as GeoTIFFs; and inconsistent definitions of rurality, for example, can hinder cross-study comparisons. To address this, we present OMEinfo, a Python-based tool for automated retrieval of consistent geographical metadata from user-provided location data. OMEinfo leverages open data sources such as the Global Human Settlement Layer, Köppen-Geiger climate classification models, and Open-Data Inventory for Anthropogenic Carbon dioxide, to ensure metadata accuracy and provenance. OMEinfo’s Dash application enables users to visualise their sample metadata on an interactive map and to investigate the spatial distribution of metadata features, which is complemented by data visualisation to analyse patterns and trends in the geographical data before further analysis. The tool is available as a Docker container, providing a portable, lightweight solution for researchers. Through its standardised metadata retrieval approach and incorporation of FAIR and Open data principles, OMEinfo promotes reproducibility and consistency in microbiome metadata. To demonstrate its utility, OMEinfo is utilised to replicate the results of a previous study linking population density to soil sample alpha diversity. As the field continues to explore the relationship between microbiomes and geographical features, tools like OMEinfo will prove vital in developing a robust, accurate, and interconnected understanding of these interactions, whilst having applicability beyond this field to any studies utilising location-based metadata. Finally, we release the OMEinfo annotation dataset, a collection of 5.3 million OMEinfo annotated samples from the ENA, for use in a retrospective analysis of sequencing samples, and highlight a number of ways researchers and sequencing read repositories can improve the quality of underlying metadata submitted to these public stores.

Recent years have been dominated by a progressive imbalance between the gradual but constant increase in the use of immunoglobulins and their availability, exacerbated by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Objectives: To provide pragmatic indications for a need-based application of high-dose immunoglobulins in the pediatric context. Sources: A literature search was performed using PubMed, from inception until 1st August 2023, including the following keywords: anti-inflammatory; children; high dose gammaglobulin; high dose immunoglobulin; immune dysregulation; immunomodulation; immunomodulatory; inflammation; intravenous gammaglobulin; intravenous immunoglobulin; off-label; pediatric; subcutaneous gammaglobulin; subcutaneous immunoglobulin. All article types were considered. Implications: In the light of the current imbalance between gammaglobulins’ demand and availability, this review advocates the urgency of a more conscious utilization of this medical product, giving indications about benefits, risks, cost-effectiveness, and administration routes of high-dose immunoglobulins in children with hematologic, neurologic, and inflammatory immune dysregulation disorders, prompting further research towards a responsible employment of gammaglobulins and improving the therapeutical decisional process.",Cells,2023,secondary,doi:10.3390/cells12192417,37830631,10572613,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/cells12192417,

Aberrant neutrophil activation may play a crucial role in the shared pathologies of KD and MIS-C; however, the associated pathogenic mechanisms and molecular drivers remain unknown. METHODS: We performed a single-cell meta-analysis of neutrophil activation with 103 pediatric single-cell transcriptomic peripheral blood mononuclear cell data across 9 cohorts, including healthy controls, KD, MIS-C, compared with dengue virus infection, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and pediatric celiac disease. We used a series of computational analyses to investigate the shared neutrophil transcriptional programs of KD and MIS-C that are linked to systemic damage and cardiac pathologies, and suggested Food and Drug Administration–approved drugs to consider as KD and MIS-C treatment. RESULTS: We meta-analyzed 521 950 high-quality cells. We found that blood signatures associated with risks of cardiovascular events are enriched in neutrophils of KD and MIS-C. We revealed the expansion of CD177+ neutrophils harboring hyperactivated effector functions in both KD and MIS-C, but not in healthy controls or in other viral-, inflammatory-, or immune-related pediatric diseases. KD and MIS-C CD177+ neutrophils had highly similar transcriptomes, marked by conserved signatures and pathways related to molecular damage. We found the induction of a shared neutrophil expression program, potentially regulated by SPI1 (Spi-1 proto-oncogene), which confers enhanced effector functions, especially neutrophil degranulation. CD177 and shared neutrophil expression program expressions were associated with acute stages and attenuated during KD intravenous immunoglobulin treatment and MIS-C recovery. Network analysis identified hub genes that correlated with the high activation of CD177+ neutrophils. Disease-gene association analysis revealed that the KD and MIS-C CD177+ neutrophils' shared expression program was associated with the development of coronary and myocardial disorders. Last, we identified and validated TSPO (translocator protein) and S100A12 (S100 calcium-binding protein A12) as main molecular targets, for which the Food and Drug Administration–approved drugs methotrexate, zaleplon, metronidazole, lorazepam, clonazepam, temazepam, and zolpidem, among others, are primary candidates for drug repurposing. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that CD177+ neutrophils may exert systemic pathological damage contributing to the shared morbidities in KD and MIS-C. We uncovered potential regulatory drivers of CD177+ neutrophil hyperactivation and pathogenicity that may be targeted as a single therapeutic strategy for either KD or MIS-C.",Circulation,2023,secondary,doi:10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.123.064734,37905415,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.123.064734,

Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a severe acute respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Different pooling testing strategies have been applied for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. However, the discrepancies among different pooling strategies are still to be explored.


METHODS
The aim of this study was to evaluate the two pooling strategies of collecting respiratory specimens for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Two groups of five-sample pools were prepared to evaluate the impact of sample pooling and pooled sampling on test sensitivity, respectively. Viral RNA of coronavirus was extracted with the automation system. The N and ORF1ab genes of SARS-CoV-2 RNA were detected with real-time reverse-transcription PCR. The turnaround time of SARS-CoV-2 testing was analyzed before and after the implement of pooled sampling.


RESULTS
The pooled sampling displayed advantages in assay sensitivity over the sample pooling. The implementation of pooled sampling significantly shortened the turnaround time of SARS-CoV-2 testing.


CONCLUSIONS
The pooled sampling is an efficient and economical strategy for SARS-CoV-2 detection during the periods of high screening demand in low-prevalence areas.",Clinical laboratory,2022,secondary,doi:10.7754/Clin.Lab.2021.210851,35536079,,https://doi.org/doi:10.7754/Clin.Lab.2021.210851,

The disease is manifested by hyperinflammation and can result in cardiac dysfunction, coronary changes, and end-organ damage. Adequate timely treatment can prevent poor outcomes in the short term, but long-term data is lacking. Methods: A large single center MIS-C cohort was followed longitudinally after treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) ± glucocorticoids to determine the natural history of the disease and to describe improvement in laboratory markers and cardiac outcomes. Patient were stratified by disease severity and compared. Results: 137 patients were identified with demographics similar to previously described cohorts. Regardless of disease severity, when adequately treated, initial lab abnormalities rapidly improved by the 6–8 month follow-up period, with some resolved in as little as 1–2 weeks. Similarly, cardiac abnormalities improved quickly after treatment; all abnormalities resolved in this cohort by 1–2 months post-hospitalization. Conclusions: Although MIS-C is a serious sequela of COVID-19, when identified quickly and treated aggressively, laboratory abnormalities, coronary dilatation, and systolic dysfunction rapidly improve with minimal long-term morbidity or mortality.",Viruses,2022,secondary,doi:10.3390/v15010094,36680134,9866445,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/v15010094,
doi:10.1021/acsnano.3c05268,A Protease-Responsive Polymer/Peptide Conjugate and Reversible Assembly of Silver Clusters for the Detection of Porphyromonas gingivalis Enzymatic Activity.,"We report the reversible aggregation of silver nanoparticle (AgNP) assemblies using the combination of a cationic arginine-based peptide and sulfur-capped polyethylene glycol (PEG). The formation and dissociation of the aggregates were studied by optical methods and electron microscopy. The dissociation of silver clusters depends on the peptide sequence and PEG size. A molecular weight of 1 kDa for PEG was optimal for the dissociation. The most important feature of this dissociation method is that it can operate in complex biofluids such as plasma, saliva, bile, urine, cell media, or even seawater without a significant decrease in performance. Moreover, the peptide-particle assemblies are highly stable and do not degrade (or express of loss of signal upon dissociation) when dried and resolubilized, frozen and thawed, or left in daylight for a month. Importantly, the dissociation capacity of PEG can be reduced via the conjugation of a peptide-cleavable substrate. The dissociation capacity is restored in the presence of an enzyme. Based on these findings, we designed a PEG-peptide hybrid molecule specific to the Porphyromonas gingivalis protease RgpB. Our motivation was that this bacterium is a key pathogen in periodontitis, and RgpB activity has been correlated with chronic diseases including Alzheimer's disease. The RgpB limit of detection was 100 pM RgpB in vitro. This system was used to measure RgpB in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) samples with a detection rate of 40% with 0% false negatives versus PCR for P. gingivalis (n = 37). The combination of PEG-peptide and nanoparticles dissociation method allows the development of convenient protease sensing that can operate independently of the media composition.",ACS nano,2023,secondary,doi:10.1021/acsnano.3c05268,37602819,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1021/acsnano.3c05268,

As a preventive measure, valid information concerning the development of antibodies is being collected for assessing the progress towards herd immunity of COVID-19. Aim: To assess the level of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG before and after vaccination by two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV 19 vaccine in a rural Medical College of West Bengal. Materials and Methods: The present interventional cohort study was conducted in a rural Medical College and Hospital, West Bengal, India, from February 2021 to August 2021. Total 248 willing subjects were included for this interventional study from the same socio-economic and geographical distribution depending upon a vaccine population of a rural Medical College of West Bengal. To measure the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody authors used Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Virology (ICMRNIV) certified Anti-SARS-CoV-2 human IgG ELISA COVID KAVACH MERILISA kit and approved protocol by the ICMR. Results: The median age of study population was 39 years (range 25-64) with 97 (39.1%) females and 151 (60.9%) males. It was found that antibody response induced by two doses of vaccination was significantly high (t-value: 28.421, p<0.001) in the vaccinated population. Conclusion: Thus, present study suggests that vaccination may be critical to develop anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody.

Despite the availability of vaccines, infection rates remain high due to immune evasive Omicron sublineages. Broad-spectrum antivirals are needed to safeguard against emerging variants and future pandemics. We used mRNA display under a reprogrammed genetic code to find a spike-targeting macrocyclic peptide that inhibits SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain infection and pseudoviruses containing spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 variants or related sarbecoviruses. Structural and bioinformatic analyses reveal a conserved binding pocket between the receptor binding domain, N-terminal domain and S2 region, distal to the ACE2 receptor-interaction site. Our data reveal a hitherto unexplored site of vulnerability in sarbecoviruses that peptides and potentially other drug-like molecules can target. Significance statement This study reports on the discovery of a macrocyclic peptide that is able to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection by exploiting a new vulnerable site in the spike glycoprotein. This region is highly conserved across SARS-CoV-2 variants and the subgenus sarbecovirus. Due to the inaccessability and mutational contraint of this site, it is anticipated to be resistant to the development of resistance through antibody selective pressure. In addition to the discovery of a new molecule for development of potential new peptide or biomolecule therapeutics, the discovery of this broadly active conserved site can also stimulate a new direction of drug development, which together may prevent future outbreaks of related viruses.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2023,secondary,doi:10.1073/pnas.2303292120,37339194,10293842,https://doi.org/doi:10.1073/pnas.2303292120,

The hidden thermodynamics of folding can drive disease, shape protein evolution, and guide protein engineering, and new approaches are needed to reveal these thermodynamics for every sequence and structure. We present cDNA display proteolysis, a new method for measuring thermodynamic folding stability for up to 900,000 protein domains in a one-week experiment. From 1.8 million measurements in total, we curated a set of ~850,000 high-quality folding stabilities covering all single amino acid variants and selected double mutants of 354 natural and 188 de novo designed protein domains 40-72 amino acids in length. Using this immense dataset, we quantified (1) environmental factors influencing amino acid fitness, (2) thermodynamic couplings (including unexpected interactions) between protein sites, and (3) the global divergence between evolutionary amino acid usage and protein folding stability. We also examined how our approach could identify stability determinants in designed proteins and evaluate design methods. The cDNA display proteolysis method is fast, accurate, and uniquely scalable, and promises to reveal the quantitative rules for how amino acid sequences encode folding stability.

In Australia, we have relied on genomic epidemiology (and associated derived parameters such as viral growth rate, reproductive number, and estimated sampling proportion) to inform public health policy changes [1]. This was possible due to the high proportion of SARS-CoV-2 cases sequenced in Australia throughout 2020 and 2021, where we maintained low burdens of both cases and deaths.

The size of this instrument is merely a few millimeters to centimeters designed to attain automation and high-throughput screening. Microfluidic systems used in LOC devices allow the manufacture of millions of microchannels, each measuring mere micrometers. These microchannels enable control of fluids in infinitesimal quantities for a variety of diagnoses. Several labs on a chip have been commercialized in recent times for fundamental procedures, including glucose monitoring, human immunodeficiency virus, early tumor detection, and cardiac diagnostics. The LOC integrates microfluidics, nanosensors, micro-electrics, and biochemistry on one device. The advantages of the chip include its sustainability and cutback wastage. It expedites a decline in reagent costs and requires minimal sample volumes. The analysis and response are faster and the response is better controlled by equipping micro-channels. Countries with exiguous healthcare are in the face of adversity due to increased fatality rates from infectious diseases that are often curable in developed nations. In certain circumstances, impoverished healthcare clinics have the medications requisite to treat a specific condition but are in dearth of the diagnostic equipment needed to determine, in which individuals are in need of the medications.

In this regard, we previously identified T cell epitope–derived peptides within topologically and structurally essential regions of SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins by applying an immunoinformatics pipeline. In this study, we selected 30 spike- and nucleocapsid-derived peptides and assessed whether these peptides induce T cell responses and avoid major mutations found in SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Our peptide pool was highly specific, with only a single peptide driving cross-reactivity in people unexposed to SARS-COV-2, and immunogenic, inducing a polyfunctional response in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from COVID-19 recovered individuals. All peptides were immunogenic and individuals recognized broad and diverse peptide repertoires. Moreover, our peptides avoided most mutations/deletions associated with all four SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern while retaining their physicochemical properties even when genetic changes are introduced.

The genome encompasses 11 open reading frames, one of which encodes the spike or S protein that has been the target for vaccines and some of the drugs because of its role in attachment to the human host cell, as well as antibodies. Mutations in the S protein that are common among several of the variants include D614G that increases transmissibility and viral load and is often associated with P323L on the RNA dependent RNA polymerase. N501Y is a mutation in the receptor binding domain of the S protein that increases binding to the ACE-2 receptor on the human host cells by 10 fold. The discussed variants carry combinations of these and other mutations and are classified by the World Health Organization as variants of concern, variants of interest, and variants under monitoring. All variants are characterized by increased transmissibility (relative to the original SARS CoV-2), which is the reason for their ability to establish themselves. Several but not all variants are more resistant to antiviral drugs and less susceptible to antibodies/vaccines. The Delta variant that dominated the world until November 2021 causes an increased risk for hospitalization and death, but is still very susceptible to the current vaccines. The most recent variant, Omicron, is characterized by increased transmissibility and decreased antibody susceptibility.",Frontiers in bioscience,2022,secondary,doi:10.31083/j.fbl2702065,35227008,,https://doi.org/doi:10.31083/j.fbl2702065,
doi:10.48550/arXiv.2211.08157,Taming Large-Scale Genomic Analyses via Sparsified Genomics,"Searching for similar genomic sequences is an essential and fundamental step in biomedical research and an overwhelming majority of genomic analyses. State-of-the-art computational methods performing such comparisons fail to cope with the exponential growth of genomic sequencing data. We introduce the concept of sparsified genomics where we systematically exclude a large number of bases from genomic sequences and enable much faster and more memory-efficient processing of the sparsified, shorter genomic sequences, while providing similar or even higher accuracy compared to processing non-sparsified sequences. Sparsified genomics provides significant benefits to many genomic analyses and has broad applicability. We show that sparsifying genomic sequences greatly accelerates the state-of-the-art read mapper (minimap2) by 1.54-8.8x using real Illumina, HiFi, and ONT reads, while providing a higher number of mapped reads and more detected small and structural variations. Sparsifying genomic sequences makes containment search through very large genomes and very large databases 72.7-75.88x faster and 723.3x more storage-efficient than searching through non-sparsified genomic sequences (with CMash and KMC3). Sparsifying genomic sequences enables robust microbiome discovery by providing 54.15-61.88x faster and 720x more storage-efficient taxonomic profiling of metagenomic samples over the state-of-art tool (Metalign).

Here, we measured vaccine-induced neutralizing activities against the D614G-CoV2 baseline virus and eight variants, including Omicron, in a panel of CoV2 infected- (n=13) and uninfected- (n=63) vaccinated kidney and heart transplant recipients. In the CoV2 uninfected-vaccinated subset, only 19% and 35% of two and three-dose vaccinated recipients respectively possessed minimally protective neutralizing plasma antibody titers (IC50>1:50) against D614G. In contrast, all of the CoV2 infected-vaccinated SOTRs who received two vaccine doses possessed titers exceeding minimal protection; 12/13 exhibiting strong protection (IC50>1:600) against D614G with minimal increases provided by a third dose. Omicron was the most resistant variant: only 10% of CoV2 uninfected-vaccinated SOTRs reached the minimally protective neutralization titer, while 76% of CoV2 infected-vaccinated SOTRs exceeded this value. These results indicate that prior infection and vaccination can induce highly protective antibody responses in many SOTRs, and identify important factors (shorter time since transplantation, prednisone administration, and African American ethnicity) that limit these responses. Overall, these results suggest factors to consider in establishing optimum COVID-19 vaccination strategies in these cohorts.",,2022,secondary,doi:10.1101/2022.02.10.22270607,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2022.02.10.22270607,

Studies have shown that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 can affect multiple human organs and physiological systems, but the respiratory system remains the primary location for viral infection. Areas covered We summarize how omics technologies are used in SARS-CoV-2 research and specifically review the current knowledge of COVID-19 from the aspect of human bronchial-pulmonary proteomics. Also, knowledge gaps in COVID-19 that can be fulfilled by proteomics are discussed. Expert opinion Overall, human bronchial-pulmonary proteomics plays an important role in revealing the dynamics, functions, tropism, and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2, which is crucial for COVID-19 biomarker and therapeutic target discoveries.

How much benefit would such systems offer? We developed, empirically validated, and mathematically characterized a quantitative model that simulates disease spread and detection time for any given disease and detection system. We find that hospital monitoring could have detected COVID-19 in Wuhan 0.4 weeks earlier than it was actually discovered, at 2,300 cases compared to 3,400. Wastewater monitoring would not have accelerated COVID-19 detection in Wuhan, but provides benefit in smaller catchments and for asymptomatic or long-incubation diseases like polio or HIV/AIDS. Monitoring of air travel provides little benefit in most scenarios we evaluated.

In rare cases, however, infection with some subtypes can result in paralysis or death. Of the 300 subtypes known, only poliovirus is reportable, limiting our understanding of the distribution of other enteroviruses that can cause clinical disease. Objective The overarching objectives of this study were to: 1) describe the distribution of enteroviruses in Arizona during the late summer and fall of 2022, the time of year when they are thought to be most abundant, and 2) demonstrate the utility of viral pan-assay approaches for semi-agnostic discovery that can be followed up by more targeted assays and phylogenomics Methods This study utilizes pooled nasal samples collected from school-aged children and long-term care facility residents, and wastewater from multiple locations in Arizona during July-October of 2022. We used PCR to amplify and sequence a region common to all enteroviruses, followed by species-level bioinformatic characterization using the QIIME 2 platform. For Enterovirus-D68 (EV-D68), detection was carried out using RT-qPCR, followed by confirmation using near-complete whole EV-D68 genome sequencing using a newly designed tiled amplicon approach. Results In the late summer and early fall of 2022, multiple enterovirus species were identified in Arizona wastewater, with Coxsackievirus A6, EV-D68, and Coxsackievirus A19 composing 86% of the characterized reads sequenced. While EV-D68 was not identified in pooled human nasal samples, and the only reported acute flaccid myelitis case in Arizona did not test positive for the virus, an in-depth analysis of EV-D68 in wastewater revealed that the virus was circulating from August through mid-October. A phylogenetic analysis revealed just one importation into the state led to local circulation. Significance This study further supports the utility of wastewater-based epidemiology to identify potential public health threats. Our further investigations into EV-D68 shows how these data might help inform healthcare diagnoses for children presenting with concerning neurological symptoms.

Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a rare and serious systemic inflammatory disorder that occurs following a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. This study aims to investigate the clinical manifestations, risk factors associated with pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission, and outcome among children with MIS-C in Taiwan.


METHODS
A retrospective analysis was conducted among pediatric patients diagnosed with MIS-C between June 2022 and February 2023 at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou, Taiwan. Data on demographics, clinical features, laboratory findings, treatment modalities, and outcomes were collected and analyzed.


RESULTS
Twenty-eight MIS-C patients, including 9 boys and 19 girls, with an average age of 5.3 ± 3.8 years old, were enrolled. Most of the cases (78.6%) were diagnosed following the first pandemic wave of COVID-19 in Taiwan. The leading clinical manifestations observed were fever (100%), skin rash (64.3%), tachycardia (46.4%), and vomiting (46.4%). Nine patients (32.1%) were admitted to the PICU due to hypotension or neurological manifestations. Higher levels of band-form white blood cells, procalcitonin, ferritin, d-dimer, prothrombin time, NT-proBNP, and lower platelet levels on arrival were associated with PICU admission (p = 3.9 × 10-2 ,9 × 10-3 , 4 × 10-3 ,1 × 10-3 , 5 × 10-3 , 4.1 × 10-2 , and 3.4 × 10-2 , respectively). Arrhythmia in one case (3.5%) and coronary artery abnormalities, including dilatation in two cases (7.1%) and small aneurysms in one case (3.5%) were identified. Regardless of ICU admission, no patients experienced systolic dysfunction or mortality following treatment.


CONCLUSION
MIS-C cases in Taiwan have a favorable outcome. Although one-third of the patients required PICU admission, none of the MIS-C cases resulted in severe cardiovascular morbidity or mortality. This study provides valuable insights into the clinical manifestations and outcomes associated with PICU admission in children with MIS-C in Taiwan.",International journal of rheumatic diseases,2023,secondary,doi:10.1111/1756-185X.14970,37947261,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1111/1756-185X.14970,

Long-read RNAseq (IsoSeq) enables more accurate quantification of isoforms, shedding light on their specific roles. To assess the medical relevance of measuring RNA isoform expression, we sequenced 12 aged human frontal cortices (6 Alzheimer’s disease cases and 6 controls; 50% female) using one Oxford Nanopore PromethION flow cell per sample. Our study uncovered 53 new high-confidence RNA isoforms in medically relevant genes, including several where the new isoform was one of the most highly expressed for that gene. Specific examples include WDR4 (61%; microcephaly), MYL3 (44%; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), and MTHFS (25%; major depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder). Other notable genes with new high-confidence isoforms include CPLX2 (10%; schizophrenia, epilepsy) and MAOB (9%; targeted for Parkinson’s disease treatment). We identified 1,917 medically relevant genes expressing multiple isoforms in human frontal cortex, where 1,018 had multiple isoforms with different protein coding sequences, demonstrating the need to better understand how individual isoforms from a single gene body are involved in human health and disease, if at all. Exactly 98 of the 1,917 genes are implicated in brain-related diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease genes such as APP (Aβ precursor protein; five), MAPT (tau protein; four), and BIN1 (eight). As proof of concept, we also found 99 differentially expressed RNA isoforms between Alzheimer’s cases and controls, despite the genes themselves not exhibiting differential expression. Our findings highlight the significant knowledge gaps in RNA isoform diversity and their medical relevance.

The immunogenicity of SARS-CoV2 vaccination is still largely unknown in adolescents or young adults affected by IBD (pIBD). We investigated the safety and immunogenicity of the BNT162B2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in 27 pIBD, as compared to 30 healthy controls (HC). Immunogenicity was measured by anti-SARS-CoV2 IgG (anti-S and anti-trim Ab) before vaccination, after 21 days (T21) and 7 days after the second dose (T28). The safety profile was investigated by close monitoring and self-reported adverse events. Vaccination was well tolerated, and short-term adverse events reported were only mild to moderate. Three out of twenty-seven patients showed IBD flare after vaccination, but no causal relationship could be established. Overall, pIBD showed a good humoral response upon vaccination compared to HC; however, pIBD on anti-TNFα treatment showed lower anti-S Ab titers compared to patients receiving other immune-suppressive regimens (p = 0.0413 at first dose and p = 0.0301 at second dose).

Design, setting, participants, & measurements Using Bayesian multivariable spatiotemporal models, we estimated the association between vaccine exposure and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) severe infections (with hospital admission) in dialysis patients from simultaneous incidence in the general population. For dialysis patients, cases were reported within the French end-stage kidney disease REIN registry from March 11, 2020, to April 29, 2021, and vaccine exposure (first dose) was reported in weekly national surveys since January 2021. Cases in the general population were obtained from the national exhaustive inpatient surveillance system (SI-VIC database), and vaccination coverage (first dose) was obtained from the national surveillance system (VAC-SI database). Results During the first wave, incidence in dialysis patients was approximately proportional to the general population. However, we showed a lower relative incidence for dialysis patients during the second wave (compared with that observed in nondialysis patients), suggesting an effect of prevention measures. Moreover, from the beginning of the vaccination rollout, incidence in dialysis patients was lower compared with predictions based on the first and second waves. Adding vaccination coverages in dialysis and nondialysis patients as predictors allowed the reported cases to be fit correctly (3685 predicted cases, 95% confidence interval, 3552 to 3816, versus 3620 reported). Incidence rate ratios were 0.37 (95% confidence interval, 0.18 to 0.71) for vaccine exposure in dialysis patients and 0.50 (95% confidence interval, 0.40 to 0.61) per 10% higher in vaccination coverage in the same-age general population, meaning that vaccine exposure in dialysis patients and the general population was independently associated with lower hospitalization rate of dialysis patients.

Previous studies have suggested that genetic susceptibility, together with an inducing infectious agent, could be involved in KD pathogenesis; however, the precise causative agent of this disease remains unknown. Moreover, there are still debates concerning whether KD is an infectious disease or an autoimmune disease, although many studies have begun to show that various pathogens functioning as critical inducers could activate different kinds of immune cells, consequently leading to the dysfunction of endothelial cells and systematic vasculitis. Here in this review, we attempt to summarize all the available evidence concerning pathogen infections associated with KD pathogenesis. We also discuss the related mechanisms, present a future perspective, and identify the open questions that remain to be investigated, thereby providing a comprehensive description of pathogen infections and their correlations with the host immune system in leading to KD.",Frontiers in Microbiology,2023,secondary,doi:10.3389/fmicb.2023.1313838,38188572,10771848,https://doi.org/doi:10.3389/fmicb.2023.1313838,

In this study, we compare the sequence diversity of SARS-CoV-2 amplified from wastewater influent to the Columbia, South Carolina, metropolitan wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and the University of South Carolina campus during September 2020, which represents the peak of COVID-19 cases at the university during 2020. A total of 92 unique mutations were detected across all WWTP influent and campus samples, with the highest frequency mutations corresponding to the SARS-CoV-2 20C and 20G clades. Signature mutations for the 20G clade dominated SARS-CoV-2 sequences amplified from localized wastewater samples collected at the University of South Carolina, suggesting that the peak in COVID-19 cases during early September 2020 was caused by an outbreak of the 20G lineage. Thirteen mutations were shared between the university building-level wastewater samples and the WWTP influent collected in September 2020, 62% of which were nonsynonymous substitutions. Co-occurrence of mutations was used as a similarity metric to compare wastewater samples. Three pairs of mutations co-occurred in university wastewater and WWTP influent during September 2020. Thirty percent of the detected mutations, including 12 pairs of concurrent mutations, were only detected in university samples. This report affirms the close relationship between the prevalent SARS-CoV-2 genotypes of the student population at a university campus and those of the surrounding community.

doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0290256,A capacitive laser-induced graphene based aptasensor for SARS-CoV-2 detection in human saliva,"SARS-CoV-2 virus induced CoVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the development of diagnostic tools. Devices integrated with electrochemical biosensors may be an interesting alternative to respond to the high demand for testing, particularly in contexts where access to standard detection technologies is lacking. Aptamers as recognition elements are useful due to their stability, specificity, and sensitivity to binding target molecules. We have developed a non-invasive electrochemical aptamer-based biosensor targeting SARS-CoV-2 in human saliva. The aptamer is expected to detect the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 wildtype and its variants. Laser-induced graphene (LIG) electrodes coated with platinum nanoparticles were biofunctionalized with a biotin-tagged aptamer. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) for BA.1 sensing was conducted in sodium chloride/sodium bicarbonate solution supplemented with pooled saliva. To estimate sensing performance, the aptasensor was tested with contrived samples of UV-attenuated virions from 10 to 10,000 copies/ml. Selectivity was assessed by exposing the aptasensor to non-targeted viruses (hCoV-OC43, Influenza A, and RSV-A). EIS data outputs were further used to select a suitable response variable and cutoff frequency. Capacitance increases in response to the gradual loading of the attenuated BA.1. The aptasensor was sensitive and specific for BA.1 at a lower viral load (10–100 copies/ml) and was capable of discriminating between negative and positive contrived samples (with strain specificity against other viruses: OC43, Influenza A, and RSV-A). The aptasensor detected SARS-CoV-2 with an estimated LOD of 1790 copies/ml in contrived samples. In human clinical samples, the aptasensor presents an accuracy of 72%, with 75% of positive percent of agreement and 67% of negative percent of agreement. Our results show that the aptasensor is a promising candidate to detect SARS-CoV-2 during early stages of infection when virion concentrations are low, which may be useful for preventing the asymptomatic spread of CoVID-19.",PLOS ONE,2023,secondary,doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0290256,37590297,10434860,https://doi.org/doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0290256,

doi:10.1128/jvi.00770-23,Efficient clathrin-mediated entry of enteric adenoviruses in human duodenal cells,"ABSTRACT Enteric adenovirus types F40 and 41 (EAdVs) are a leading cause of diarrhea and diarrhea-associated death in young children and have recently been proposed to cause acute hepatitis in children. EAdVs have a unique capsid architecture and exhibit — unlike other human adenoviruses — a relatively strict tropism for gastrointestinal tissues with, to date, understudied infection mechanism and unknown target cells. In this study, we turn to potentially limiting host factors by comparing EAdV entry in cell lines with respiratory and intestinal origin by cellular perturbation, virus particle tracking, and transmission electron microscopy. Our analyses highlight kinetic advantages for EAdVs in duodenal HuTu80 cell infection and reveal a larger fraction of mobile particles, faster virus uptake, and infectious particle entry in intestinal cells. Moreover, EAdVs display a dependence on clathrin- and dynamin-dependent pathways in intestinal cells. Detailed knowledge of virus entry routes and host factor requirements is essential to understanding pathogenesis and developing new countermeasures. Hence, this study provides novel insights into the entry mechanisms of a medically important virus with emerging tropism in a cell line originating from a relevant tissue. IMPORTANCE Enteric adenoviruses have historically been difficult to grow in cell culture, which has resulted in lack of knowledge of host factors and pathways required for infection of these medically relevant viruses. Previous studies in non-intestinal cell lines showed slow infection kinetics and generated comparatively low virus yields compared to other adenovirus types. We suggest duodenum-derived HuTu80 cells as a superior cell line for studies to complement efforts using complex intestinal tissue models. We show that viral host cell factors required for virus entry differ between cell lines from distinct origins and demonstrate the importance of clathrin-mediated endocytosis.

However, analyzing such large amounts of sensitive data raises key concerns regarding data privacy, specifically when the information is outsourced to third-party infrastructures for data storage and processing (e.g., cloud computing). Current solutions for data privacy protection resort to centralized designs or cryptographic primitives that impose considerable computational overheads, limiting their applicability to large-scale genomic analysis. We introduce Gyosa, a secure and privacy-preserving distributed genomic analysis solution. Unlike in previous work, Gyosa follows a distributed processing design that enables handling larger amounts of genomic data in a scalable and efficient fashion. Further, by leveraging trusted execution environments (TEEs), namely Intel SGX, Gyosa allows users to confidentially delegate their GWAS analysis to untrusted third-party infrastructures. To overcome the memory limitations of SGX, we implement a computation partitioning scheme within Gyosa. This scheme reduces the number of operations done inside the TEEs while safeguarding the users’ genomic data privacy. By integrating this security scheme in Glow, Gyosa provides a secure and distributed environment that facilitates diverse GWAS studies. The experimental evaluation validates the applicability and scalability of Gyosa, reinforcing its ability to provide enhanced security guarantees. Further, the results show that, by distributing GWASes computations, one can achieve a practical and usable privacy-preserving solution.",bioRxiv,2024,secondary,doi:10.1101/2024.01.15.575678,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2024.01.15.575678,

As with many inflammatory diseases, it is the combination of specific host and environmental factors in certain individuals that provokes disease outcomes. The microbiota metabolites influence activity of epigenetic enzymes. The knowledge of the mechanisms of action of environmental pollution now includes not only the alteration of the gut microbiota but also the interaction between different human microbiota niches such as the lung–gut axis. The epigenetic regulations can reprogram differentiated cells in response to environmental changes. The microbiota can play a major role in the progression and suppression of several epigenetic diseases.

However, the literature has become increasingly unambiguous in defining the role of exosomes in chronic cerebrovascular diseases. Because they can pass through the blood–brain barrier, they have great potential to reflect intracerebral changes.

In Australia, travel bans for non-residents and quarantine requirements for returned travellers were eased in November 2021, providing pathways for influenza viruses to be re-introduced. Aim We aimed to describe the epidemiological and virological characteristics of the re-emergence of influenza in Victoria, Australia to inform public health interventions. Methods From 1 November 2021 to 30 April 2022, we conducted an epidemiological study analysing case notification data from the Victorian Department of Health to describe case demographics, interviewed the first 200 cases to establish probable routes of virus reintroduction and examined phylogenetic and antigenic data to understand virus diversity and susceptibility to current vaccines. Results Overall, 1,598 notifications and 1,064 positive specimens were analysed. The majority of cases (61.4%) occurred in the 15–34 years age group. Interviews revealed a higher incidence of international travel exposure during the first month of case detections, and high levels of transmission in university residential colleges were associated with return to campus. Influenza A(H3N2) was the predominant subtype, with a single lineage predominating despite multiple importations. Conclusion Enhanced testing for respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic provided a more complete picture of influenza virus transmission compared with previous seasons. Returned international travellers were important drivers of influenza reemergence, as were young adults, a group whose role has previously been under-recognised in the establishment of seasonal influenza epidemics. Targeting interventions, including vaccination, to these groups could reduce future influenza transmission.",Eurosurveillance,2023,secondary,doi:10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2023.28.37.2300118,37707981,10687983,https://doi.org/doi:10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2023.28.37.2300118,

Advances in genomics have boosted the fine‐mapping of disease‐associated genetic variants across human genome. In healthcare practice, interpreting intricate genetic profiles into actionable medical decisions can improve health outcomes but remains challenging. Here an intelligent genetic decoder is engineered with programmable DNA computation to automate clinical analyses and interpretations. The DNA‐based decoder recognizes multiplex genetic information by one‐pot ligase‐dependent reactions and interprets implicit genetic profiles into explicit decision reports. It is shown that the DNA decoder implements intended computation on genetic profiles and outputs a corresponding answer within hours. Effectiveness in 30 human genomic samples is validated and it is shown that it achieves desirable performance on the interpretation of CYP2C19 genetic profiles into drug responses, with accuracy equivalent to that of Sanger sequencing. Circuit modules of the DNA decoder can also be readily reprogrammed to interpret another pharmacogenetics genes, provide drug dosing recommendations, and implement reliable molecular calculation of polygenic risk score (PRS) and PRS‐informed cancer risk assessment.

Their impact on viral infection, transmission, and efficacy of vaccines and therapeutics remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that recently emerged BQ.1.1. and XBB.1 variants bind ACE2 with high affinity and promote membrane fusion more efficiently than earlier Omicron variants. Structures of the BQ.1.1 and XBB.1 RBDs bound to human ACE2 and S309 Fab (sotrovimab parent) explain the altered ACE2 recognition and preserved antibody binding through conformational selection. We show that sotrovimab binds avidly to all Omicron variants, promotes Fc-dependent effector functions and protects mice challenged with BQ.1.1, the variant displaying the greatest loss of neutralization. Moreover, in several donors vaccine-elicited plasma antibodies cross-react with and trigger effector functions against Omicron variants despite reduced neutralizing activity. Cross-reactive RBD-directed human memory B cells remained dominant even after two exposures to Omicron spikes, underscoring persistent immune imprinting. Our findings suggest that this previously overlooked class of cross-reactive antibodies, exemplified by S309, may contribute to protection against disease caused by emerging variants through elicitation of effector functions.",bioRxiv,2023,secondary,doi:10.1101/2023.01.17.523798,36711984,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2023.01.17.523798,

The retrospective study included 15 patients. The diagnosis was verified according to the Guidelines of the Russian Ministry of Health (version dated July 3, 2020). The results of clinical, instrumental and laboratory examination of patients were evaluated in comparison with literature data.Results and discussion. The prevalence of MIS-C in the Komi Republic was 5.5 per 100,000 persons under 18 years of age. The majority of the study cohort were males (66.7%), the median age was 3 years. 46.7% of cases were between the ages of 8 and 14 years. At the onset of clinical manifestations, all patients had fever and gastrointestinal symptoms. In 80% of children, pathological changes of skin and mucous membranes, as well as respiratory disorders were revealed. Involvement of the cardiovascular system in the pathological process was noted in 66.7% of cases. Less frequently, the urinary tract was affected. When analyzing laboratory data, an increase in the level of inflammatory markers, as well as lymphopenia and neutrophilia, were noted. Most patients received therapy with intravenous immunoglobulin and systemic glucocorticoids, as well as anticoagulants and acetylsalicylic acid. The outcomes of the disease in most cases were favorable, in 6.7% of patients a lethal outcome was recorded.Conclusion. The analysis of cases of MIS-C illustrates the high frequency of seroconversion to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the predominance of males compared to females (2:1 ratio), the prevalence of the age group under 4 years, the heterogeneity of clinical manifestations and generally favorable prognosis. The diversity of clinical features of COVID-19 warrants a high degree of suspicion for MIS-C, as well as the development of a predictive tool, the ""MIS-C Suspicion Index"".",Modern Rheumatology Journal,2023,secondary,doi:10.14412/1996-7012-2023-3-22-29,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.14412/1996-7012-2023-3-22-29,

doi:10.1097/PAS.0000000000002084,Clinicopathologic Features of Severe Acute Hepatitis Associated With Adenovirus Infection in Children,"A recent increase in reports of severe acute hepatitis of unknown etiology in children is under investigation. Although adenovirus has been frequently detected, its role remains unclear, and systematic histopathologic analysis is lacking. We conducted a retrospective study of 11 children hospitalized between October 2021 and May 2022 with unexplained acute hepatitis and concurrent adenovirus infection. Liver biopsies collected shortly after admission demonstrated moderately to severely active hepatitis in 8/11 (73%) cases, characterized by marked portal mixed inflammation, moderate-to-severe interface activity, and milder lobular inflammation. Clusters of plasma cells were present in 6/11 (55%) cases, mimicking autoimmune hepatitis. Semiquantitative scoring of 17 discrete histologic features found that greater degrees of portal inflammation, interface activity, bile duct injury, bile ductular reaction, lobular inflammation, Kupffer cell activation, and hepatocyte focal necrosis were significantly more common in these cases in comparison to the control group of unexplained acute severe hepatitis without adenovirus infection. Liver biopsy immunohistochemistry was negative for adenovirus in all cases. Polymerase chain reaction testing of liver tissue was positive for the enteric adenovirus serotypes 41 (species F) in 10/11 (91%) cases. An immunoprofile study of hepatic infiltrating lymphocytes in 1 patient revealed the presence of large numbers of CD3+ and CD4+ lymphocytes. Nine patients received supportive treatment without steroids and recovered without the need for liver transplantation. In summary, liver injury in children with severe acute hepatitis and adenovirus infection is characterized by a hepatitic pattern that resembles severe autoimmune hepatitis and may represent an immune-mediated process associated with viral infection.",The American Journal of Surgical Pathology,2023,secondary,doi:10.1097/PAS.0000000000002084,37357941,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1097/PAS.0000000000002084,

Current barriers related to the findable, accessible, interoperable, and reproducible use of space-flown pharmaceutical data have contributed to a lack of progress beyond application of earth-based principles. To directly tackle these challenges, we have produced a novel database of all the drugs flown into space, compiled from publicly available ontological and spaceflight-related datasets, to exemplify analyses for describing significant spaceflight-related targets. By focusing on mechanisms perturbed by spaceflight, we have provided a novel avenue for identifying the most relevant changes within the drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion pathways. We suggest a set of space genes, by necessity limited to available tissue types, that can be expanded and modified based on future tissue-specific and mechanistic-specific high-throughput assays. In sum, we provide the justification and a definitive starting point for pharmacogenomics guided spaceflight as a foundation of precision medicine, which will enable long-term human habitation of the Moon, Mars, and beyond.

Dissecting an accurate machine learning model1 for human odor perception, we find a computable representation for odor at the molecular level that can predict the odor-evoked receptor, neural, and behavioral responses of nearly all terrestrial organisms studied in olfactory neuroscience. Using this olfactory representation (Primary Odor Map, POM), we find that odorous compounds with similar POM representations are more likely to co-occur within a substance and be metabolically closely related; metabolic reaction sequences2 also follow smooth paths in POM despite large jumps in molecular structure.

doi:10.3389/fbuil.2023.1063804,Microbiota shaping and bioburden monitoring of indoor antimicrobial surfaces,"Indoor residents are constantly exposed to dynamic microbiota that have significant health effects. In addition to hand hygiene, cleaning, and disinfection, antimicrobial coatings (AMCs) can prevent the spread of infectious diseases in public areas. The sustainable use of antimicrobial-coated products requires an assessment of their pros and cons for human health and the environment. The toxicity and resistance risks of AMCs have been considered, but large-scale genetic studies on the microbial community compositions and resistomes of AMCs are scarce. The use of an AMC can reduce the total number of microbes on a surface but poses the risk of dysbiosis, microbial imbalance, such as the polarized growth of metallophilic, metal- and antimicrobial-resistant, and other survivor bacteria, and the overall reduction of microbial diversity. Loss of diversity may lead to the enrichment of harmful bacteria and an increased risk of communicable or immunological non-communicable inflammatory diseases (NCDs). In public buildings, such as kindergartens and nursing homes for the elderly, the use of AMCs is likely to increase due to epidemics and pandemics in recent years. Therefore, comprehensive metagenomic research is needed to monitor the effects of AMCs on indoor microbial community compositions and functions. Although the determination of good indoor microbiota and homeostasis is difficult, microbial communities that have health-protective or harmful effects can and should be identified using a metagenomic sequencing approach before the large-scale implementation of AMCs.",,2023,secondary,doi:10.3389/fbuil.2023.1063804,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.3389/fbuil.2023.1063804,

High-throughput sequencing leads to an etiological diagnosis in up to 50% of individuals with heterogeneous neurodevelopmental or malformation disorders. There is a growing interest in additional omics technologies in translational research settings to examine the remaining unsolved cases. Methods: We gathered 30 individuals with malformation syndromes and/or severe neurodevelopmental disorders with negative trio exome sequencing and array comparative genomic hybridization results through a multicenter project. We applied short-read genome sequencing, total RNA sequencing, and DNA methylation analysis, in that order, as complementary translational research tools for a molecular diagnosis. Results: The cohort was mainly composed of pediatric individuals with a median age of 13.7 years (4 years and 6 months to 35 years and 1 month). Genome sequencing alone identified at least one variant with a high level of evidence of pathogenicity in 8/30 individuals (26.7%) and at least a candidate disease-causing variant in 7/30 other individuals (23.3%). RNA-seq data in 23 individuals allowed two additional individuals (8.7%) to be diagnosed, confirming the implication of two pathogenic variants (8.7%), and excluding one candidate variant (4.3%). Finally, DNA methylation analysis confirmed one diagnosis identified by genome sequencing (Kabuki syndrome) and identified an episignature compatible with a BAFopathy in a patient with a clinical diagnosis of Coffin-Siris with negative genome and RNA-seq results in blood.

Complete, telomere-to-telomere (T2T) genome assemblies promise improved analyses and the discovery of new variants, but many essential genomic resources remain associated with older reference genomes. Thus, there is a need to translate genomic features and read alignments between references.

In addition to enabling the use of several references, we demonstrate that aligning reads to a high-quality reference (for example, T2T-CHM13) and lifting to an older reference (for example, Genome reference Consortium (GRC)h38) improves the accuracy of the resulting variant calls on the old reference. By leveraging the quality improvements of T2T-CHM13, levioSAM2 reduces small and structural variant calling errors compared with GRC-based mapping using real short- and long-read datasets.

However, choosing suitable two-dimensional materials for gas sensors is a challenge. Germanene can be a good candidate because of its outstanding electronic and structural properties. Based on the density functional theory calculations with various schemes, such as PBE + vdW-DF2, HSE06 + PBE, and HSE06 + vdW-DF2, we elucidated the structural and electronic properties of germanene substrates (perfect, vacancy-1, and vacancy-2) while adsorbing hepatocellular carcinoma-related volatile organic compounds (VOCs), i.e., acetone, 1,4-pentadiene, methylene chloride, phenol, and allyl methyl sulfide. These gases have been selected for investigation because of their most frequent occurence in diagnosing the disease. We found that vacancy substrates enhanced the adsorption strength of the VOCs compared to the perfect one, where the phenol adsorbed most strongly and exhibited the most profound influence on the structural deformation of the substrates over the other VOCs. Besides, the adsorbed VOCs significantly modified the energy bandgap of the considered germanene substrates. In particular, the gases, except allyl methyl sulfide, vanished the bandgap of the vacancy-1 germanene and converted this substrate from a semiconductor to a metal, while they widened the bandgap of the vacancy-2 structure compared to the isolated case. Therefore, the perfect and vacancy-2 germanene sheets could maintain their semiconducting state upon gas adsorption, implying that these substrates may be suitable candidates for gas sensing applications. The nature of the interaction between the VOCs and the germanene substrates is a physical adsorption with a weak charge exchange, which mainly comes from the contribution of the pz orbital of the VOCs and the pz orbital of Ge.",RSC Advances,2023,secondary,doi:10.1039/d3ra05927h,38090092,10714202,https://doi.org/doi:10.1039/d3ra05927h,

This study aimed to determine the COVID-19 vaccination status in Egyptian CHD patients and to analyze the safety and detailed side effect profile of the COVID-19 vaccine among these patients. (2) Methods: This survey-based study was conducted on 670 end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients on CHD from 3 December 2021 to 5 February 2022. Subjects were asked about sociodemographic characteristics, clinical and therapeutic data, in addition to their COVID-19 vaccination status. If the subject had been vaccinated, we inquired about the type of vaccine and the side effects that occurred within a few days after administration of the first and second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Additionally, subjects were asked about the onset of side effects (days from vaccination), timing of maximum symptoms, intensity of symptoms and their effect on activity and need for medical attention. (3) Results: The study included 670 CHD patients with a mean age of 50.79 years; 58.1% were females. The vast majority (614; 91.6%) of the studied patients received two doses of the vaccine. Side effects were more commonly reported after the first dose than the second dose. The main side effects reported were generalized weakness/fatigue (56%), headache (43.8%) and fever (40.4%), and sore arm/pain was also reported (29.3%).

The aims of this study were to characterize SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater samples, and to identify variants of concern present in samples collected from wastewater treatment plants in South African urban metros from April 2021 to January 2022. A total of 325 samples were collected from 15 wastewater treatment plants. Nucleic acids were extracted from concentrated samples, and subjected to amplicon-based whole genome sequencing. To identify variants of concerns and lineages, we used the Freyja tool (https://github.com/andersen-lab/Freyja), which assigns each sample with the prevalence of each variant present. We also used signature mutation analysis to identify variants in each wastewater treatment site. A heatmap was generated to identify patterns of emerging mutations in the spike gene using Excel conditional formatting. Using the Freyja tool, the Beta variant was detected and became predominate from April to June 2021 followed by the Delta variant and lastly the Omicron variant. Our heatmap approach was able to identify a pattern during the changes of predominate variant in wastewater with the emergence of mutations and the loss of others. In conclusion, sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater largely corresponded with sequencing from clinical specimens. Our heatmap has the potential to detect new variants prior to emergence in clinical samples and this may be particularly useful during times of low disease incidence between waves, when few numbers of positive clinical samples are collected and submitted for testing. A limitation of wastewater sequencing is that it is not possible to identify new variants, as variants are classified based on known mutations in clinical strains.",,2022,secondary,doi:10.1101/2022.12.15.22283506,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2022.12.15.22283506,

doi:10.1021/acsami.1c24191,Monitoring Clinical-Pathological Grading of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Using MicroRNA-Guided Semiconducting Polymer Dots.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, noncoding RNAs involved in nearly all genetic central dogma processes and human biological behavior, which also play a significant role in the pathological activity of tumors, such as gene transcription, protein translation, and exosome secretion. Therefore, through the navigation of certain specific miRNAs, we can trace the specific physiological processes or image some specific tissues. Designing and accurately positioning microRNA (miRNA)-sensitive fluorescent nanoprobes with benign specificity and recognition in cells or tissues are a challenging research field. To solve the difficulties, we introduce four semiconducting polymer dots (Pdots) as nanoprobes linked by specific miRNA antisense sequences for monitoring the pathological grading by the variation in miRNA expression. Based on the base pairing principle, these miRNA-sensitive Pdots could bind to specific miRNAs within the cancerous cells. As impacted by the background of different pathology gradings, the proportions of the four hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-specific miRNAs within the cancerous cell are different, and the pathological grading of the patient tissues can be determined by comparing the palette combinations. The short single-stranded RNA-functionalized Pdots, which have excellent microRNA sensitivity, are observed in an experimental cell model and a series of tissue specimens from HCC patients for the first time. Using the Förster (or fluorescence) resonance energy transfer (FRET) model of Pdots and Cy3dt tag to simulate in vivo miRNA detection, the superior sensitivity and specificity of these nanoprobes are verified. The interference of subjective factors in traditional single/bis-dye emission intensity detection is abandoned, and multiple label staining is used to enhance sensitivity further and reduce the false-positive rate. The feasibility exhibited by this novel staining method is verified in normal hepatocellular HCC cell lines and 16 frozen ultrathin tissue sections, which are employed to quantify pathological grading-related color presentation systems for clinical doctors and pathologists' use. The intelligently designed miRNA-guided Pdots will emerge as an ideal platform with promising biological imaging.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2022,secondary,doi:10.1021/acsami.1c24191,35112844,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1021/acsami.1c24191,

COVID-19 is a multiorgan disease involving multiple intricated pathological mechanisms translated into clinical, biochemical, and molecular changes, including microRNAs. MicroRNAs are essential post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression, being involved in the modulation of most biological processes. In this study, we characterized the biological impact of SARS-CoV-2 interacting microRNAs differentially expressed in COVID-19 disease by analyzing their impact on five distinct tissue transcriptomes. To this end, we identified the microRNAs’ predicted targets within the list of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in tissues affected by high loads of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Next, we submitted the tissue-specific lists of the predicted microRNA-targeted DEGs to gene network functional enrichment analysis. Our data show that the upregulated microRNAs control processes such as mitochondrial respiration and cytokine and cell surface receptor signaling pathways in the heart, lymph node, and kidneys. In contrast, downregulated microRNAs are primarily involved in processes related to the mitotic cell cycle in the heart, lung, and kidneys.

The effectiveness of IL-1 receptor antagonist, anakinra, is debated. Patients and methods We conducted an anonymous retrospective multicenter study on MIS-C patients treated with anakinra in Italy from January 2020 to February 2021. Our study outcomes included the percentage of patients who required further therapeutic step-up, the percentage of patients who experienced fever resolution within 24 h and a reduction of CRP by half within 48 h, and the percentage of patients who developed Coronary Artery Anomalies (CAA) during follow-up. Results 35 cases of MIS-C were treated in 10 hospitals. Of these, 13 patients started anakinra while in the ICU, and 22 patients started anakinra in other wards. 25 patients (71.4%) were treated with corticosteroids at a starting dose 2–30 mg/Kg/day plus IVIG (2 g/Kg), 10 patients (28.6%) received only corticosteroids without IVIG. Anakinra was administered intravenously to all patients in Group A (mean dose 8 mg/Kg/day), and subcutaneously in Group B (mean dose 4 mg/Kg/day). Only two patients required further treatment step-up and no patients developed CAA after receiving anakinra. The most commonly observed side effect was an increase in ALT, occurring in 17.1% of patients. Conclusions In this retrospective cohort of severe MIS-C patients treated with anakinra we report favorable clinical outcomes with a low incidence of side effects.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a zinc metalloproteinase and a critical modulator of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). In addition, ACE2 has anti-inflammatory and antifibrosis functions. ACE has become widely known in the past decade as it has been identified as the primary receptor for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, being closely associated with their infection. SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets the lung, which induces a cytokine storm by infecting alveolar cells, resulting in tissue damage and eventually severe acute respiratory syndrome. In the lung, innate immunity acts as a critical line of defense against pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2. This review aims to summarize the regulation of ACE2, and lung host cells resist SARS-CoV-2 invasion by activating innate immunity response.

The inability to rapidly discriminate MIS-C from similar febrile illnesses delays treatment and leads to misdiagnosis. To identify diagnostic discriminators at the time of emergency department presentation, we enrolled 104 children who met MIS-C screening criteria, 14 of whom were eventually diagnosed with MIS-C. Before treatment, we collected breath samples for volatiles and peripheral blood for measurement of plasma proteins and immune cell features. Clinical and laboratory features were used as inputs for a machine learning model to determine diagnostic importance. MIS-C was associated with significant changes in breath volatile organic compound (VOC) composition as well as increased plasma levels of secretory phospholipase A2 (PLA2G2A) and lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP). In an integrated model of all analytes, the proportion of TCRVbeta21.3+ non-naive CD4 T cells expressing Ki-67 had a high sensitivity and specificity for MIS-C, with diagnostic accuracy further enhanced by low sodium and high PLA2G2A.

doi:10.3389/fped.2022.981711,Clinical characteristics of children with MIS-C fulfilling classification criteria for macrophage activation syndrome,"Background Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a potentially life-threatening complication of various inflammatory disorders, including multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). MIS-C refractory to treatment should raise suspicion of MAS, which can be fatal if a definitive diagnosis is delayed. Unfortunately, there is a lack of data on MAS in children with MIS-C. Objective Our study aims to analyze the risk factors for the development of MAS in MIS-C, its clinical course and response to treatment, and identify predictive factors for pediatric intensive care. Material and methods We analyzed data from the Polish MIS-C registry of the MultiOrgan Inflammatory Syndromes COVID-19 Related Study. Patients were diagnosed according to the WHO MIS-C definition and treated according to national guidelines (Polish Pediatric Society) based on international consensus. MAS definition was based on 2016 Classification Criteria for Macrophage Activation Syndrome Complicating Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis. Results Two-hundred and seventy four children met the study inclusion criteria. Fifty-nine patients fulfilled MAS classification criteria, nine of which required admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). MIS-C patients with MAS were significantly older than patients without MAS (median 11.2 vs. 8.1 years). Multivariable analysis showed that age, symptoms characteristic of atypical Kawasaki disease, and skin erosions were significant factors associated with MAS in MIS-C patients. Analysis of laboratory parameters showed that on admission, MIS-C patients with MAS had significantly lower median lymphocyte and platelet counts, albumin and sodium levels, and higher median levels of C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, ferritin, D-dimers, triglycerides, serum creatinine, urea, and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, and neutrophil count. Multivariate analysis showed that higher procalcitonin, ferritin, and fibrinogen levels at admission were predictive of MAS. Only elevated troponin level was a factor indicating a requirement of PICU hospitalization for children with MAS. MIS-C patients fulfilling MAS criteria were treated more often with intravenous immunoglobulins and steroids than children without MAS. Children with MAS more often required mechanical ventilation. None of the patients required biological agents.

To describe associations between the Child Opportunity Index (COI) and multisystem inflammatory syndrome of childhood (MIS-C) diagnosis among hospitalized children.


METHODS
We used a retrospective case control study design to examine children ≤21 years hospitalized at a single, tertiary care children's hospital between March 2020 and June 2021. Our study population included children diagnosed with MIS-C (n = 111) and a control group of children hospitalized for MIS-C evaluation who had an alternative diagnosis (n = 61). Census tract COI was the exposure variable, determined using the patient's home address mapped to the census tract. Our outcome measure was MIS-C diagnosis. Odds ratios measured associations between COI and MIS-C diagnosis.


RESULTS
Our study population included 111 children diagnosed with MIS-C and 61 children evaluated but ruled out for MIS-C. The distribution of census tract overall COI differed significantly between children diagnosed with MIS-C compared with children with an alternate diagnosis (P = .03). Children residing in census tracts with very low to low overall COI (2.82, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.29-6.17) and very low to low health/environment COI (4.69, 95% CI 2.21-9.97) had significantly higher odds of being diagnosed with MIS-C compared with children living in moderate and high to very high COI census tracts, respectively.

The safety and efficacy of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) mRNA vaccines was established in healthy adolescents, yet there were few data for humoral and cellular immunogenicity in adolescents with cardiac diseases. Methods We evaluated anti‐spike antibodies, neutralizing activities, and interferon‐gamma production prior to and post SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccination in adolescents with cardiac diseases and healthy controls. Results Five healthy adolescents and 26 patients cardiac diseases including congenital heart disease (CHD, n=10), dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM, n=4), idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH, n=4), and post‐heart transplantation (HTx, n=8) were enrolled. No severe adverse events including myocarditis and pericarditis were noted, even in patients with severe heart failure. Febrile events were noted in 21 of 62 injections (34%). All the healthy adolescents and 21 of the 26 patients (81%) showed sufficient elevation of neutralizing antibodies after the second dose of vaccination. Neutralizing antibodies and cellular immunity were absent in four of the eight post‐HTx patients and one with CHD of single ventricle. There was no correlation between the anti‐spike and neutralizing antibody titers and interferon‐gamma levels. When comparing the clinical characteristics of the patients post‐HTx who did or did not acquire antibodies, there were no significant differences in the immunosuppressant types and trough levels.

On the other hand, the prevalence of IBD patients over 65-years-old is steadily increasing, and, with this, there is a large population of patients that presents more comorbidities, polypharmacy, and, more frequently, frailty compared to younger patients, exposing them to potentially major risks for adverse events deriving from newer therapies, e.g., infections, cardiovascular risks, and malignancies. Unfortunately, pivotal trials for the commercialization of new therapies rarely include older IBD patients, and those with serious comorbidities are virtually excluded.

Patients most often saw family practitioners (34%), otolaryngologists (20%), and Taste/Smell clinics (6%) for smell/taste dysfunction. 64% of patients who went to Taste/Smell clinics received smell testing, followed by 39% of patients who saw otolaryngologists, and 31% of patients who saw family practitioners. Factors associated with increased odds of diagnosis included age (25-39 years (OR 2.97, 95% CI [2.25, 3.95]), 40-60 (OR 3.3, 95% CI [2.56, 4.52]), and >60 (OR 4.25, 95% CI [3.21, 5.67]) vs. 18-24 years), male gender (OR 1.26, 95% CI [1.07, 1.48]), insurance status (private (OR 1.61, 95% CI[1.15, 2.30]) or public (OR 2.03, 95% CI [1.42, 2.95]) vs. uninsured), perception of their family practitioner to be knowledgeable (OR 2.12, 95% CI [1.16, 3.90]), otolaryngologic evaluation (OR 6.17, 95% CI [5.16, 7.38]), and psychophysical smell testing (OR 1.77, 95% CI [1.42, 2.22]). CONCLUSION: Psychophysical testing, otolaryngologic evaluation, patient assessment of family practitioner knowledge level, insurance, age, and gender are significant factors in obtaining smell/taste dysfunction diagnosis. This study identifies barriers to diagnosis including lack of insurance or access to specialist evaluation and highlights the importance of educating family practitioners in diagnosis and management of patients with smell/taste disorders.",medRxiv,2023,secondary,doi:10.1101/2023.09.20.23295861,37790453,10543242,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2023.09.20.23295861,

doi:10.1101/2023.04.02.535277,Community structure and temporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 epistatic network allows for early detection of emerging variants with altered phenotypes,"The rise of viral variants with altered phenotypes presents a significant public health challenge. In particular, the successive waves of COVID-19 have been driven by emerging variants of interest (VOIs) and variants of concern (VOCs), which are linked to modifications in phenotypic traits such as transmissibility, antibody resistance, and immune escape. Consequently, devising effective strategies to forecast emerging viral variants is critical for managing present and future epidemics. Although current evolutionary prediction tools mainly concentrate on single amino acid variants (SAVs) or isolated genomic changes, the observed history of VOCs and the extensive epistatic interactions within the SARS-CoV-2 genome suggest that predicting viral haplotypes, rather than individual mutations, is vital for efficient genomic surveillance. However, haplotype prediction is significantly more challenging problem, which precludes the use of traditional AI and Machine Learning approaches utilized in most mutation-based studies. This study demonstrates that by examining the community structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein epistatic networks, it is feasible to efficiently detect or predict emerging haplotypes with altered transmissibility. These haplotypes can be linked to dense network communities, which become discernible significantly earlier than their associated viral variants reach noticeable prevalence levels. From these insights, we developed HELEN (Heralding Emerging Lineages in Epistatic Networks), a computational framework that identifies densely epistatically connected communities of SAV alleles and merges them into haplotypes using a combination of statistical inference, population genetics, and discrete optimization techniques. HELEN was validated by accurately identifying known SARS-CoV-2 VOCs and VOIs up to 10-12 months before they reached perceptible prevalence and were designated by the WHO. For example, our approach suggests that the spread of the Omicron haplotype or a closely related genomic variant could have been foreseen as early as the start of 2021, almost a year before its WHO designation. Moreover, HELEN offers greater scalability than phylogenetic lineage tracing methods, allowing for the analysis of millions of available SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Besides SARS-CoV-2, our methodology can be employed to detect emerging and circulating strains of any highly mutable pathogen with adequate genomic surveillance data.",bioRxiv,2023,secondary,doi:10.1101/2023.04.02.535277,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2023.04.02.535277,

In Australia, travel bans for non-residents and quarantine requirements for returned travellers were eased in November 2021, providing pathways for influenza viruses to be re-introduced. Methods: From 1 November 2021 to 30 April 2022 we conducted an epidemiological study to investigate the re-establishment of influenza in Victoria, Australia. We analyzed case notification data from the Victorian Department of Health to describe case demographics, interviewed the first 200 cases to establish probable routes of virus reintroduction, and examined phylogenetic and antigenic data to understand virus diversity and susceptibility to current vaccines. Results: Overall, 1598 notifications and 1064 positive specimens were analyzed. The majority of cases occurred in the 15-34 year age group. Case interviews revealed a higher incidence of international travel exposure during the first month of case detections and high levels of transmission in university residential colleges associated with the return to campus. Influenza A(H3N2) was the dominant subtype, with a single lineage predominating despite multiple importations. Conclusions: Enhanced testing for respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic provided a more complete picture of influenza virus transmission compared to previous seasons. Returned international travellers were important drivers of the re-emergence of influenza, as were young adults, a group whose role has previously been under-recognised in the establishment of seasonal influenza epidemics.

Recombinant human antibodies are proven potent neutralizers of viruses and can block the interaction of viral surface proteins with their host receptors. To develop neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, antibody gene libraries from convalescent COVID-19 patients were constructed and recombinant antibody fragments (scFv) against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit of the viral spike (S) protein were selected by phage display. The selected antibodies were produced in the scFv-Fc format and 30 showed more than 80% inhibition of spike (S1-S2) binding to cells expressing ACE2, assessed by flow cytometry screening assay. The majority of these inhibiting antibodies are derived from the VH3-66 V-gene. The antibody STE90-C11 showed a sub nM IC50 in a plaque-based live SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay. The in vivo efficacy of the antibody was demonstrated in the Syrian hamster and in the hACE2 mice model using a silenced human IgG1 Fc part. The crystal structure of STE90-C11 Fab in complex with SARS-CoV-2-RBD was solved at 2.0 Å resolution showing that the antibody binds at the same region as ACE2 to RBD. The binding and inhibtion of STE90-C11 is not blocked by many known RBD mutations including N439K, L452R, E484K or L452R+E484Q (emerging B.1.617). STE90-C11 derived human IgG1 with FcγR silenced Fc (COR-101) is currently undergoing Phase Ib/II clinical trials for the treatment of moderate to severe COVID-19. In Brief Human antibodies were selected from convalescent COVID-19 patients using antibody phage display. The antibody STE90-C11 is neutralizing authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus in vitro and in vivo and the crystal structure of STE90-C11 in complex with SARS-CoV-2-RBD revealed that this antibody is binding in the RBD-ACE2 interface.

Methods for DNA detection generally rely on fluorescent or colorimetric readout. The development of label-free assays decreases costs and test complexity. We present a novel method combining a one-pot isothermal generation of DNA nanoballs with their detection by electrical impedance. We modified loop-mediated isothermal amplification by using compaction oligonucleotides that self-assemble the amplified target into nanoballs. Next, we use capillary-driven flow to passively pass these nanoballs through a microfluidic impedance cytometer, thus enabling a fully compact system with no moving parts. The movement of individual nanoballs is detected by a change in impedance providing a quantized readout. This approach is flexible for the detection of DNA/RNA of numerous targets (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, HIV, β-lactamase gene, etc.), and we anticipate that its integration into a standalone device would provide an inexpensive (<$5), sensitive (10 target copies), and rapid test (<1 hour).",Science Advances,2023,secondary,doi:10.1126/sciadv.adi4997,37672583,10482329,https://doi.org/doi:10.1126/sciadv.adi4997,

The major cause of accumulation of pollutants in soil are anthropogenic activities and some natural processes. There are several types of soil pollutants which deteriorate the quality of human life and animal health. They are recalcitrant hydrocarbon compounds, metals, antibiotics, persistent organic compounds, pesticides and different kinds of plastics. Due to the detrimental properties of pollutants present in soil on human life and ecosystem such as carcinogenic, genotoxic and mutagenic effects, alternate and effective methods to degrade the pollutants are recommended. Bioremediation is an effective and inexpensive method of biological degradation of pollutants using plants, microorganisms and fungi. With the advent of new detection methods, the identification and degradation of soil pollutants in different ecosystems were made easy. Metagenomic approaches are a boon for the identification of unculturable microorganisms and to explore the vast bioremediation potential for different pollutants. Metagenomics is a power tool to study the microbial load in polluted or contaminated land and its role in bioremediation. In addition, the negative ecosystem and health effect of pathogens, antibiotic and metal resistant genes found in the polluted area can be studied.

Its rapid spread and high infection rate are attributed to a mutation in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 allowing the virus to invade human cells much faster and with increased efficiency. Particularly, an especially dangerous mutation P681R close to the furin cleavage site has been identified as responsible for increasing the infection rate. Together with the earlier reported mutation D614G in the same domain, it offers an excellent instance to investigate the nature of mutations and how they affect the interatomic interactions in the spike protein. Here, using ultra large-scale ab initio computational modeling, we study the P681R and D614G mutations in the SD2-FP domain including the effect of double mutation and compare the results with the wild type. We have recently developed a method of calculating the amino acid-amino acid bond pairs (AABP) to quantitatively characterize the details of the interatomic interactions, enabling us to explain the nature of mutation at the atomic resolution. Our most significant find is that the mutations reduce the AABP value, implying a reduced bonding cohesion between interacting residues and increasing the flexibility of these amino acids to cause the damage. The possibility of using this unique mutation quantifiers in a machine learning protocol could lead to the prediction of emerging mutations.",Viruses,2021,secondary,doi:10.3390/v14030465,35336872,8955942,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/v14030465,

Approximately 10% to 20% of patients with Kawasaki disease (KD) are refractory to initial intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy. KD is mainly associated with coronary artery abnormalities.


OBJECTIVES
To identify and evaluate all developed prediction models for IVIG resistance in patients with KD and synthesize evidence from external validation studies that evaluated their predictive performances.


DATA SOURCES
PubMed Medline, Dialog Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from inception until October 5, 2021.


STUDY SELECTION
All cohort studies that reported patients diagnosed with KD who underwent an initial IVIG of 2 g/kg were selected.


DATA EXTRACTION
Study and patient characteristics and model performance measures. Two authors independently extracted data from the studies.


RESULTS
The Kobayashi, Egami, Sano, Formosa, and Harada scores were the only prediction models with 3 or more external validation of the161 model analyses in 48 studies. The summary C-statistics were 0.65 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.57-0.73), 0.63 (95% CI: 0.55-0.71), 0.58 (95% CI: 0.55-0.60), 0.50 (95% CI: 0.36-0.63), and 0.63 (95% CI: 0.44-0.78) for the Kobayashi, Egami, Sano, Formosa, and Harada models, respectively. All 5 models showed low positive predictive values (0.14-0.39) and high negative predictive values (0.85-0.92).

Recent findings Given the rarity of the disease, the question of why a minority of children develop MIS-C is not known. Certain intrinsic susceptibility factors in the host have been described. In addition to hyperinflammation induced by the innate and acquired immune cells, evidence of molecular mimicry was presented for the disease pathogenesis. As there is an increasing number of infected individuals and mass vaccination schedules, concerns regarding the usefulness of the existing diagnostic criteria sets raised. Summary Although children are likely to have a milder COVID-19 course compared with adults, MIS-C as a postinfectious and life-threatening complication was reported in the pediatric age.

CD4+ CD25high Treg expressed the chemokine receptor CCR6 in a considerable percentage, suggesting T cell homing to the vascular endothelium, lung and gut epithelial cells and brain. Treg phenotype was different than peripherally-induced Treg (pTreg) that revert from pro-inflammatory T cells under repeated stimulatory conditions, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific Treg differentiated from naïve T cells in tissues where the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins were synthetized. Twenty two of 22 subjects studied responded to vaccination developing a spike-specific CD4+ T helper (Th)1 response, and 20 of 22 developing a spike-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (CTL) response. However, in vaccine recipients the expansion of spike-specific pro-inflammatory T cells was less significant than the expansion of spike-specific Treg. Effector (TEM) and central memory (TCM) Treg were numerous as early as after two vaccine doses, with no significant differences following additional vaccine boosts. In co-culture experiments under stimulatory conditions, Treg regulated naïve T cell differentiation toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype and suppressed interferon (IFN)γ production by SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 + Th1 cells.",Autoimmunity,2023,secondary,doi:10.1080/08916934.2023.2259133,37724524,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1080/08916934.2023.2259133,

The purpose of this review is to highlight the role of blood lipids in association with thrombosis events observed in COVID-19 patients. Among different types of phospholipases A2 that target cell membrane phospholipids, there is increasing focus on the inflammatory secretory phospholipase A2 IIA (sPLA2-IIA), which is associated with the severity of COVID-19. Analysis indicates increased sPLA2-IIA levels together with eicosanoids in the sera of COVID patients. sPLA2 could metabolise phospholipids in platelets, erythrocytes, and endothelial cells to produce arachidonic acid (ARA) and lysophospholipids. Arachidonic acid in platelets is metabolised to prostaglandin H2 and thromboxane A2, known for their pro-coagulation and vasoconstrictive properties. Lysophospholipids, such as lysophosphatidylcholine, could be metabolised by autotaxin (ATX) and further converted to lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). Increased ATX has been found in the serum of patients with COVID-19, and LPA has recently been found to induce NETosis, a clotting mechanism triggered by the release of extracellular fibres from neutrophils and a key feature of the COVID-19 hypercoagulable state. PLA2 could also catalyse the formation of platelet activating factor (PAF) from membrane ether phospholipids. Many of the above lipid mediators are increased in the blood of patients with COVID-19. Together, findings from analyses of blood lipids in COVID-19 patients suggest an important role for metabolites of sPLA2-IIA in COVID-19-associated coagulopathy (CAC).",Biomedicines,2023,secondary,doi:10.3390/biomedicines11041181,37189799,10135929,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/biomedicines11041181,

The co-occurrence of specific amino acid changes, collectively named ‘virus variant’, requires scrutiny (as variants may hugely impact the agent’s transmission, pathogenesis, or antigenicity); variant evolution is studied using phylogenetics3–6. Yet, never has this problem been tackled by digging into data with ad hoc analysis techniques. Here we show that the emergence of variants can in fact be traced through data-driven methods, further capitalizing on the value of large collections of SARS-CoV-2 sequences. For all countries with sufficient data, we compute weekly counts of amino acid changes, unveil time-varying clusters of changes with similar – rapidly growing – dynamics, and then follow their evolution. Our method succeeds in timely associating clusters to variants of interest/concern, provided their change composition is well characterized. This allows us to detect variants’ emergence, rise, peak, and eventual decline under competitive pressure of another variant.

The most common symptoms of MIS-C include fever > 3 days, gastrointestinal symptoms, skin changes. Shock can often occur. The key pathomechanism of the syndrome is hyperinflammation and an altered cytokine profile. Activation of T lymphocytes in MIS-C is mediated by the superantigen, which is the spike protein of the virus. The clinical picture and the immune pathophysiological profile show similarities between MIS-C and Kawasaki diseases (KD). The relationship of MIS-C with allergic diseases has not been investigated, but by analogy it can be assumed that it will be similar to KD. Allergic rhinitis, asthma, and atopic dermatitis have been demonstrated to increase following KD. Children who have previously suffered from combined allergic diseases (atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, and urticaria) are at an increased risk of developing KD.

Such coinfections in children with COVID-19 have been reported to increase morbidity and mortality. Objectives: To identify the type and proportion of coinfections with SARS-CoV-2 and bacteria, fungi, and/or respiratory viruses, and investigate the severity of COVID-19 in children. Methods: For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched ProQuest, Medline, Embase, PubMed, CINAHL, Wiley online library, Scopus, and Nature through the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for studies on the incidence of COVID-19 in children with bacterial, fungal, and/or respiratory coinfections, published from 1 December 2019 to 1 October 2022, with English language restriction. Results: Of the 169 papers that were identified, 130 articles were included in the systematic review (57 cohort, 52 case report, and 21 case series studies) and 34 articles (23 cohort, eight case series, and three case report studies) were included in the meta-analysis. Of the 17,588 COVID-19 children who were tested for co-pathogens, bacterial, fungal, and/or respiratory viral coinfections were reported (n = 1633, 9.3%). The median patient age ranged from 1.4 months to 144 months across studies. There was an increased male predominance in pediatric COVID-19 patients diagnosed with bacterial, fungal, and/or viral coinfections in most of the studies (male gender: n = 204, 59.1% compared to female gender: n = 141, 40.9%). The majority of the cases belonged to White (Caucasian) (n = 441, 53.3%), Asian (n = 205, 24.8%), Indian (n = 71, 8.6%), and Black (n = 51, 6.2%) ethnicities. The overall pooled proportions of children with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who had bacterial, fungal, and respiratory viral coinfections were 4.73% (95% CI 3.86 to 5.60, n = 445, 34 studies, I2 85%, p < 0.01), 0.98% (95% CI 0.13 to 1.83, n = 17, six studies, I2 49%, p < 0.08), and 5.41% (95% CI 4.48 to 6.34, n = 441, 32 studies, I2 87%, p < 0.01), respectively. Children with COVID-19 in the ICU had higher coinfections compared to ICU and non-ICU patients, as follows: respiratory viral (6.61%, 95% CI 5.06–8.17, I2 = 0% versus 5.31%, 95% CI 4.31–6.30, I2 = 88%) and fungal (1.72%, 95% CI 0.45–2.99, I2 = 0% versus 0.62%, 95% CI 0.00–1.55, I2 = 54%); however, COVID-19 children admitted to the ICU had a lower bacterial coinfection compared to the COVID-19 children in the ICU and non-ICU group (3.02%, 95% CI 1.70–4.34, I2 = 0% versus 4.91%, 95% CI 3.97–5.84, I2 = 87%). The most common identified virus and bacterium in children with COVID-19 were RSV (n = 342, 31.4%) and Mycoplasma pneumonia (n = 120, 23.1%). Conclusion: Children with COVID-19 seem to have distinctly lower rates of bacterial, fungal, and/or respiratory viral coinfections than adults. RSV and Mycoplasma pneumonia were the most common identified virus and bacterium in children infected with SARS-CoV-2.

This extraordinary blend of properties makes them highly attractive for a variety of applications, such as the automotive sector, soft robotics, and the aerospace industry. At their core, vitrimer materials consist of crosslinked covalent networks that have the ability to dynamically reorganize in response to external factors, including temperature changes, pressure variations, or shifts in pH levels. In this review, the aim is to delve into the latest advancements in the theoretical understanding and computational design of vitrimers. The review begins by offering an overview of the fundamental principles that underlie the behavior of these materials, encompassing their structures, dynamic behavior, and reaction mechanisms. Subsequently, recent progress in the computational design of vitrimers is explored, with a focus on the employment of molecular dynamics (MD)/Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

We describe the phylogenomic and population genetic patterns of the virus in Mexico during the pre-vaccination stage, including asymptomatic carriers. Our RT-qPCR screening and phylogenomics directed a sequence/structure analysis of the Spike glycoprotein, revealing mutation of concern E484K in genomes from central Mexico, in addition to the nationwide prevalence of the imported variant 20C/S:452R (B.1.427/9). Overall, the detected variants in Mexico show mutations in the N-terminal domain (i.e., R190M), in the receptor-binding motif (i.e., T478K, E484K), within the S1-S2 subdomains (i.e., P681R/H, T732A), and at the basis of the protein, V1176F, raising concerns about the lack of phenotypic and clinical data available for the postulated variants of interest (VOIs) 20B/478K.V1 and P.3. Moreover, the population patterns of Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) from symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers sampled with a self-sampling scheme, revealed a bimodal distribution of polymorphisms in all three sampled localities from central Mexico, and confirmed the presence of several fixed variants, mostly from the 241T-3037T-14408T-23403G haplotype common in Asia. Despite gene flow among Mexican localities, we found differences in both the allelic frequencies among localities and the allelic imbalance of the mutation S194L of the nucleocapsid protein between symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers. Our results highlight the dual role of Spike and Nucleocapsid proteins in adaptive evolution of SARS-CoV-2 to their hosts and provide a baseline for specific follow-up of mutations of concern during the vaccination stage in Mexico.",,2021,secondary,doi:10.1101/2021.05.18.21256128,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2021.05.18.21256128,
doi:10.1101/2021.11.09.467907,Lossless indexing with counting de Bruijn graphs,"Sequencing data is rapidly accumulating in public repositories. Making this resource accessible for interactive analysis at scale requires efficient approaches for its storage and indexing. There have recently been remarkable advances in building compressed representations of annotated (or colored) de Bruijn graphs for efficiently indexing k-mer sets. However, approaches for representing quantitative attributes such as gene expression or genome positions in a general manner have remained underexplored. In this work, we propose Counting de Bruijn graphs (Counting DBGs), a notion generalizing annotated de Bruijn graphs by supplementing each node-label relation with one or many attributes (e.g., a k-mer count or its positions). Counting DBGs index k-mer abundances from 2,652 human RNA-Seq samples in over 8-fold smaller representations compared to state-of-the-art bioinformatics tools and yet faster to construct and query. Furthermore, Counting DBGs with positional annotations losslessly represent entire reads in indexes on average 27% smaller than the input compressed with gzip for human Illumina RNA-Seq and 57% smaller for PacBio HiFi sequencing of viral samples. A complete searchable index of all viral PacBio SMRT reads from NCBI’s SRA (152,884 samples, 875 Gbp) comprises only 178 GB. Finally, on the full RefSeq collection, we generate a lossless and fully queryable index that is 4.4-fold smaller than the MegaBLAST index. The techniques proposed in this work naturally complement existing methods and tools employing de Bruijn graphs and significantly broaden their applicability: from indexing k-mer counts and genome positions to implementing novel sequence alignment algorithms on top of highly compressed graph-based sequence indexes.",Genome Research,2021,secondary,doi:10.1101/2021.11.09.467907,35609994,9528980,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2021.11.09.467907,
doi:10.1088/1752-7163/ad15a3,Impact of thermal desorption tubes on the variability of exhaled breath data,"Due to the overall low abundance of volatile compounds in exhaled breath, it is necessary to preconcentrate the sample prior to traditional thermal desorption (TD) gas chromatography mass spectrometry analysis. While certain aspects of TD tubes, such as volatile storage, have been evaluated, many aspects remain uncharacterized. Two common TD tubes, Tenax TA and Biomonitoring 5TD tubes, were evaluated for background content and flow rate variability. The data illustrate that the Biomonitoring 5TD tubes have the highest number (23) and abundance of background contamination greater than 3x the mean noise when compared to Tenax TA (13) and empty tubes (9). Tentative identifications of the compounds in the background contamination experiment show that greater than 59% (16/27) of the compounds identified have been reported in the breath literature. The data illustrate the TD tube background abundance could account for more than 70% of the chromatographic signal from exhaled breath for these select compounds. Flow rate measurements of 200 Tenax TA and 200 Biomonitoring 5TD tubes show a large range in measured flow rates among the TD tubes (Tenax: 252.9–284.0 ml min−1, 5TD: 220.6–255.1 ml min−1). Finally, TD tubes of each type, Tenax TA and Biomonitoring 5TD, previously established to have high, medium, and low flow rates, show insignificant differences (p > 0.05) among the tubes of different flow rates, using both gas standards and an exhaled breath from a peppermint experiment. Collectively, these results establish overall background compounds attributed to each TD tube type tested. Additionally, while measured flow rate variability is present and plausibly impacts exhaled breath results, the data demonstrate no statistically significant difference was observed between tubes showing high, medium, and low flow rates from two separate sample types.",Journal of Breath Research,2023,secondary,doi:10.1088/1752-7163/ad15a3,38096565,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1088/1752-7163/ad15a3,

This study reveals an interaction between the long non-coding RNA NORAD, noted for its role in DNA stability, and the immune-related transcription factor STAT3. Our findings indicate that NORAD’s binding to STAT3 facilitates its nuclear entry, suppressing the antiviral response. In the absence of NORAD, STAT3 remains cytoplasmic, enabling STAT1 to activate this response. Evidence from viral infections and clinical samples reinforces this unique role for NORAD. Intriguingly, while other functions of NORAD are conserved in evolution, this newly discovered role is unique to humans, owing to the introduction of an ALU element in hominoids.

Herein, we propose a facile electrochemical biosensor based on divalent aptamer-functionalized nanochannels for highly efficient detection of cancer cell-derived exosomes. The aptamer against transmembrane receptor protein CD63 and the aptamer targeting membrane protein EpCAM are simultaneously immobilized on the nanochannels to construct the divalent aptamer-functionalized nanochannels. Thus, the target exosomes can be recognized and selectively captured by the functionalized nanochannels in a divalent collaborative manner. The combined exosomes overlay the ion channel effectively and hinder the ionic flow through the nanochannels, resulting in an evidently varied ionic transport behavior corresponding to the abundance of exosomes. The divalent aptamer-functionalized nanochannels can substantially promote the binding stability and enhance the detection specificity, while the sensitivity of detection is improved greatly by virtue of the amplified response of array channels synergized with the electrochemical technique. Therefore, the developed biosensor provides a highly specific, sensitive, and accurate approach for the detection of cancer cell-derived exosomes, which may hold great potential for application in early clinical cancer diagnosis.","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,secondary,doi:10.3390/s23229139,38005527,10674588,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/s23229139,

In this study, we recruited 100 adults from a college in China and performed 6 weeks of intervention for half of the volunteers. ABSTRACT With the exploding growth of the global market for probiotics and the rapid awakening of public awareness to manage health by probiotic intervention, there is still an active debate about whether the consumption of probiotics is beneficial for nonpatients, which is due to the lack of systematic analysis based on time series multiomics data sets. In this study, we recruited 100 adults from a college in China and performed a random case-control study by using a probiotic (Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus Probio-M9) as an intervention for 6 weeks, aiming to achieve a comprehensive evaluation and understanding of the beneficial effect of Probio-M9 consumption. By testing advanced blood immunity indicators, sequencing the gut microbiome, and profiling the gut metabolome at baseline and the end of the study, we found that although the probiotic intervention has a limited impact on the human immunity and the gut microbiome and metabolome, the associations between the immunity indicators and multiomics data were strengthened, and further analysis of the gut microbiome’s genetic variations revealed inhibited generation of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) by probiotic consumption. Taken together, our findings indicated an underestimated influence of the probiotic, not on altering the microbial composition but on strengthening the association between human immunity and commensal microbes and stabilizing the genetic variations of the gut microbiome. IMPORTANCE Although the global market for probiotics is growing explosively, there is still an active debate about whether the consumption of probiotics is beneficial for nonpatients. In this study, we recruited 100 adults from a college in China and performed 6 weeks of intervention for half of the volunteers. By analyzing the time series multiomics data in this study, we found that the probiotic intervention (i) has a limited effect on human immunity or the global structure of the gut microbiome and metabolome, (ii) can largely influence the correlation of the development between multiomics data and immunity, which was not able to be discovered by conventional differential abundance analysis, and (iii) can inhibit the generation of SNVs in the gut microbiome instead of promoting it.",Microbiology Spectrum,2023,secondary,doi:10.1128/spectrum.03609-22,36912650,10100958,https://doi.org/doi:10.1128/spectrum.03609-22,
doi:10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1190994,The assessment of qualitative olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19 patients: a systematic review of tools and their content validity,"Background There is a lack of overview of the tools used to assess qualitative olfactory dysfunction, including parosmia and phantosmia, following COVID-19 illness. This could have an impact on the diagnosis and treatment offered to patients. Additionally, the formulations of symptoms are inconsistent and often unclear, and consensus around the wording of questions and responses is needed. Aim of study The aim of this systematic review is to provide an overview of tools used to assess qualitative olfactory dysfunction after COVID-19, in addition to addressing the content validity (i.e., item and response formulations) of these tools. Methods MEDLINE, Web of Science, and EMBASE were searched 5th of August 2022 and updated on the 25th of April 2023 to identify studies that assess qualitative olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19 patients. Primary outcomes were the tool used (i.e., questionnaire or objective test) and item and response formulations. Secondary outcomes included psychometric properties, study design, and demographic variables. Results The assessment of qualitative olfactory dysfunction is characterized by heterogeneity, inconsistency, and lack of validated tools to determine the presence and degree of symptoms. Several tools with overlapping and distinct features were identified in this review, of which some were thorough and detailed, while others were merely assessing the presence of symptoms as a binary measure. Item and response formulations are also inconsistent and often used interchangeably, which may lead to confusion, incorrect diagnoses, and inappropriate methods for solving the problem. Conclusions There is an unmet need for a reliable and validated tool for assessing qualitative olfactory dysfunction, preferably one that also captures quantitative olfactory issues (i.e., loss of smell), to ensure time-effective and specific assessment of the ability to smell. A consensus around the formulation of items and response options is also important to increase the understanding of the problem, both for clinicians, researchers, and the patient, and ultimately to provide the appropriate diagnosis and treatment.

SARS-CoV-2 may trigger the development or progression of autoimmune diseases. To test this, we used a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection and convalescent patients’ blood and SG in order to understand the development of SjD-like autoimmunity after infection. First, SARS-CoV-2–infected human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) transgenic mice exhibited decreased salivation, elevated antinuclear antibodies (ANA), and lymphocytic infiltration in the lacrimal and SG. The sera from patients with COVID-19 sera showed increased ANA (i.e., anti-SSA [Sjögren’s-syndrome-related antigen A]/anti-Ro52 and anti-SSB [SS-antigen B]/anti-La). Male patients showed elevated anti-SSA compared with female patients, and female patients exhibited diverse ANA patterns. SG biopsies from convalescent COVID-19 patients were microscopically similar to SjD SG with focal lymphocytic infiltrates in 4 of 6 patients and 2 of 6 patients exhibiting focus scores of at least 2. Lastly, monoclonal antibodies produced in recovered patients blocked ACE2/spike interaction and cross-reacted with nuclear antigens. Our study shows a direct association between SARS-CoV-2 and SjD.

Of these, 24 (29.6%) were included in the MIS-C group (MIS-C/g) and 57 were included in the suspected appendicitis group (S-A/g), which consisted of two subgroups: appendicitis group (A/g) and control observation group (CO/g). Results Comparing MIS-C/g, A/g, and CO/g, duration of abdominal pain (2.4, 1.5, 1.8 days), high-grade fever (38.8, 36.7, 37°C), severe vomiting, and severe diarrhea were higher in MIS-C/g. Lymphocytes count (LC) was lower, while values of C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, and coagulopathy were higher in MIS-C/g (p < 0.05). The optimal cutoffs for the duration of abdominal pain was 2.5 days; the duration of fever, 1.5 days; peak value of fever, 39°C; neutrophil count, 13,225 × 1,000 cell/µMoL; LC, 600 × 1,000 cell/µMoL; ferritin, 233 µg/L; and D-dimer, 16.4 mg/L (p < 0.05). The optimal cutoff for CRP was 130 mg/L (sensitivity 88.9, specificity 100%, positive predictive value 100%, NPV, negative predictive value 92.5%, p < 0.001). All patients in MIS-C/g tested positive by serology by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Conclusion The duration of abdominal pain, presence of high-grade and prolonged fever, and evaluation of hemogram in terms of high neutrophil count and low LC exhibit high sensitivity and negative predictive value for MIS-C presenting with AAP. In case of doubt, inflammatory markers such as CRP, ferritin, D-dimer, and serology for SARS-CoV-2 should be studied to confirm the diagnosis.",European Journal of Pediatric Surgery,2021,secondary,doi:10.1055/s-0041-1732320,34298578,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1055/s-0041-1732320,

Two versions of the variant were identified, both with the prevalent D614G mutation in the spike protein together with four novel point mutations and with an E484K or S477N mutation in the receptor binding domain, raising concerns of possible resistance to vaccine-elicited and therapeutic antibodies. We report that convalescent sera and vaccine-elicited antibodies retain full neutralizing titer against the S477N B.1.526 variant and neutralize the E484K version with a modest 3.5-fold decrease in titer as compared to D614G. The E484K version was neutralized with a 12-fold decrease in titer by the REGN10933 monoclonal antibody but the combination cocktail with REGN10987 was fully active. The findings suggest that current vaccines and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies will remain protective against the B.1.526 variants.

The mechanisms underpinning the pathophysiology of MIS-C are poorly understood. Moreover, clinically distinguishing MIS-C from other childhood infectious and inflammatory conditions, such as Kawasaki Disease (KD) or severe bacterial and viral infections is challenging due to overlapping clinical and laboratory features. We aimed to determine a set of plasma protein biomarkers that could discriminate MIS-C from those other diseases. Methods: Seven candidate protein biomarkers for MIS-C were selected based on literature and from whole blood RNA-Sequencing data from patients with MIS-C and other diseases. Plasma concentrations of ARG1, CCL20, CD163, CORIN, CXCL9, PCSK9 and ADAMTS2 were quantified in MIS-C (n=22), KD (n=23), definite bacterial (DB; n=28) and viral (DV, n=27) disease, and healthy controls (n=8). Logistic regression models were used to determine the discriminatory ability of individual proteins and protein combinations to identify MIS-C, and association with severity of illness. Results: Plasma levels of CD163, CXCL9, and PCSK9 were significantly elevated in MIS-C with a combined AUC of 86% (95% CI: 76.8%-95.1%) for discriminating MIS-C from other childhood diseases. Lower ARG1 and CORIN plasma levels were significantly associated with severe MIS-C cases requiring oxygen, inotropes or with shock. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of a host protein biomarker signature for MIS-C and may provide new insight into its pathophysiology.",,2023,secondary,doi:10.1101/2023.07.28.23293197,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2023.07.28.23293197,

The reasons of such differences are not yet established. We examined cytokines in sera and Th and B cell subpopulations in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 40 children (<18 years old), evaluating the impact of COVID-19 infection during the pandemic’s first waves. We correlated our results with clinical symptoms and compared them to samples obtained from 16 infected adults and 7 healthy controls. While IL6 levels were lower in SARS-CoV-2+ children as compared to adult patients, the expression of other pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFNγ and TNFα directly correlated with early age infection and symptoms. Th and B cell subsets were modified during pediatric infection differently with respect to adult patients and controls and within the pediatric group based on age. Low levels of IgD− CD27+ memory B cells correlated with absent/mild symptoms. On the contrary, high levels of FoxP3+/CD25high T-Regs associated with a moderate–severe clinical course in the childhood. These T and B cells subsets did not associate with severity in infected adults, with children showing a predominant expansion of immature B lymphocytes and natural regulatory T cells. This study shows differences in immunopathology of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children compared with adults.

However, synchronously enhancing dual-modal imaging signals under a single stimulus is challenging. Herein, we propose an activatable bimodal probe that integrates aggregation-induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) and iron oxide nanoparticles (IOs) to synergistically enhance near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) intensity and magnetic resonance (MR) contrast through a tumor acidity-mediated click reaction. Tumor acidity-responsive IOs containing dibenzocyclooctyne groups (termed cDIOs) and AIEgens containing azide groups (termed AATs) can be covalently cross-linked in response to tumor acidity, which leads to a simultaneous enhancement in NIRF intensity (~12.4-fold) and r2 relaxivity (~2.8-fold). cDIOs and AATs were effective activated in mice orthotropic breast tumor, and the cross-linking prolonged their retention in tumor, further augmenting the bimodal signals and expanding imaging time frame. This facile strategy leverages the inherent properties of probes themselves and demonstrates promise in future translational studies.",Angewandte Chemie,2023,secondary,doi:10.1002/anie.202310975,37950819,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1002/anie.202310975,

Using publicly available SARS-CoV-2 sequence and epidemiological data, we developed discrete phylogeographic models to interrogate the emergence and dispersal of the Delta and Omicron variants in 2021 between and across California and Mexico. External introductions of Delta and Omicron in the region peaked in early July (2021-07-10 [95% CI: 2021-04-20, 2021-11-01]) and mid-December (2021-12-15 [95% CI: 2021-11-14, 2022-01-09]), respectively, 3 months and 2 weeks after first detection. These repeated introductions coincided with domestic migration events with no evidence of a unique transmission hub. The spread of Omicron was most consistent with gravity centric patterns within Mexico. While cross-border events accounted for only 5.1% [95% CI: 4.3–6] of all Delta migration events, they accounted for 20.6% [95% CI: 12.4–29] of Omicron movements, paralleling the increase in international travel observed in late 2021. Our investigations of the Delta and Omicron epidemics in the California/Mexico region illustrate the complex interplay and the multiplicity of viral and structural factors that need to be considered to limit viral spread, even as vaccination is reducing disease burden.

However, sample numbers from each study are low due to limited crew availability, hardware, and space. To increase statistical power, spaceflight RNA-seq datasets from different missions are often aggregated together. However, this can introduce technical variation or “batch effects”, often due to differences in sample handling, sample processing, and sequencing platforms. Several computational methods have been developed to correct for technical batch effects, thereby reducing their impact on true biological signals. Methods: In this study, we combined 7 mouse liver RNA-seq datasets from NASA GeneLab (part of the NASA Open Science Data Repository) to evaluate several common batch effect correction methods (ComBat and ComBat-seq from the sva R package, and Median Polish, Empirical Bayes, and ANOVA from the MBatch R package). Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to identify library preparation method and mission as the primary sources of batch effect among the technical variables in the combined dataset. We next quantitatively evaluated the ability of each of the indicated methods to correct for each identified technical batch variable using the following criteria: BatchQC, PCA, dispersion separability criterion, log fold change correlation, and differential gene expression analysis. Each batch variable/correction method combination was then assessed using a custom scoring approach to identify the optimal correction method for the combined dataset, by geometrically probing the space of all allowable scoring functions to yield an aggregate volume-based scoring measure. Results and Discussion: Using the method described for the combined dataset in this study, the library preparation variable/ComBat correction method pair out ranked the other candidate pairs, suggesting that this combined dataset should be corrected for library preparation using the ComBat correction method prior to downstream analysis. We describe the GeneLab multi-study analysis and visualization portal which will allow users to access the publicly available space biology ‘omics data, select multiple studies to combine for analysis, and examine the presence or absence of batch effects using multiple metrics. If the user chooses to perform batch effect correction, the scoring approach described here can be implemented to identify the optimal correction method to use for their specific combined dataset prior to analysis.",,2023,secondary,doi:10.3389/fspas.2023.1200132,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.3389/fspas.2023.1200132,

The syndrome was originally described as a post-infectious complication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, which usually causes COVID-19. During the COVID-19 pandemic, not only did the virus undergo mutations but vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 were also developed. Both these conditions led to a decrease in the incidence of MIS-C.

It develops approximately 4 weeks after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection and involves hyperinflammation with multisystem injury, commonly progressing to shock. The exact pathomechanism of MIS‐C is not known, but immunological dysregulation leading to cytokine storm plays a central role. In response to the emergence of MIS‐C, the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) established a task force (TF) within the Immunology Section in May 2021. With the use of an online Delphi process, TF formulated clinical statements regarding immunological background of MIS‐C, diagnosis, treatment, follow‐up, and the role of COVID‐19 vaccinations. MIS‐C case definition is broad, and diagnosis is made based on clinical presentation. The immunological mechanism leading to MIS‐C is unclear and depends on activating multiple pathways leading to hyperinflammation. Current management of MIS‐C relies on supportive care in combination with immunosuppressive and/or immunomodulatory agents. The most frequently used agents are systemic steroids and intravenous immunoglobulin. Despite good overall short‐term outcome, MIS‐C patients should be followed‐up at regular intervals after discharge, focusing on cardiac disease, organ damage, and inflammatory activity. COVID‐19 vaccination is a safe and effective measure to prevent MIS‐C. In anticipation of further research, we propose a convenient and clinically practical algorithm for managing MIS‐C developed by the Immunology Section of the EAACI.",Pediatric Allergy and Immunology,2023,secondary,doi:10.1111/pai.13900,36705045,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1111/pai.13900,

 There is pressing urgency to identify drugs that allow treating COVID-19 patients effectively. Respiratory failure is the leading cause of death in patients with severe COVID-19, and the host inflammatory response at the lungs remains poorly understood. Therefore, we retrieved data from postmortem lungs from COVID-19 patients and performed in-depth in silico analyses of single-nucleus RNA sequencing data, inflammatory protein interactome network, functional enrichment, and shortest pathways to cancer hallmark phenotypes to reveal potential therapeutic targets and drugs in advanced-stage COVID-19 clinical trials. Herein, we analyzed transcriptomics data of 719 inflammatory response genes across 19 cell types (116,313 nuclei) from lung autopsies. The functional enrichment analysis of the 233 significantly expressed genes showed that the most relevant biological annotations were: inflammatory response, innate immune response, cytokine production, interferon production, macrophage activation, thymic stromal lymphopoietin, blood coagulation, IL-1 and megakaryocytes in obesity, NLRP3 inflammasome complex, and the TLR, JAK-STAT, NF-κB, TNF, oncostatin M, AGE-RAGE signaling pathways. Subsequently, we identified 34 essential inflammatory proteins with both high-confidence protein interactions and shortest pathways to inflammation, cell death, glycolysis, and angiogenesis. Lastly, we propose five small molecules involved in advanced-stage COVID-19 clinical trials: baricitinib, pacritinib, and ruxolitinib are tyrosine-protein kinase JAK2 inhibitors, losmapimod is a MAP kinase p38 alpha inhibitor, and eritoran is a TLR4/MD-2 antagonist.

Viruses giving rise to the different 501Y lineages have, presumably under intense natural selection following a shift in host environment, independently acquired multiple unique and convergent mutations. As a consequence all have gained epidemiological and immunological properties that will likely complicate the control of COVID-19. Here, by examining patterns of mutations that arose in SARS-CoV-2 genomes during the pandemic we find evidence of a major change in the selective forces acting on immunologically important SARS-CoV-2 genes (such as N and S) that likely coincided with the emergence of the 501Y lineages. In addition to involving continuing sequence diversification, we find evidence that a significant portion of the ongoing adaptive evolution of the 501Y lineages also involves further convergence between the lineages. Our findings highlight the importance of monitoring how members of these known 501Y lineages, and others still undiscovered, are convergently evolving similar strategies to ensure their persistence in the face of mounting infection and vaccine induced host immune recognition.",medRxiv,2021,secondary,doi:10.1101/2021.02.23.21252268,33688681,7941658,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2021.02.23.21252268,

Profound alterations in T cell responses have been well characterized in the course of adult severe COVID-19, but little is known about the T cell function in children with COVID-19. Here, we made three major observations in a cohort of symptomatic children with acute COVID-19: 1) a reduced frequency of circulating FoxP3+ regulatory T cells, 2) the prevalence of a TH17 polarizing microenvironment characterized by high plasma levels of IL-6, IL-23, and IL17A, and an increased frequency of CD4+ T cells expressing ROR-γt, the master regulator of TH17 development, and 3) high plasma levels of ATP together with an increased expression of the P2X7 receptor. Moreover, that plasma levels of ATP displayed an inverse correlation with the frequency of regulatory T cells but a positive correlation with the frequency of CD4+ T cells positive for the expression of ROR-γt.

Left ventricular global myocardial strain has been proved to be one of the best evidence of the diagnostic and prognostic implications for cardiac dysfunction. The global myocardial strain change of MIS-C in the acute phase was still unclear. Methods PubMed and other sources were searched. A network meta-analysis was conducted. MIS-C was divided into two groups according to left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF): MIS-C with depressed ejection fraction (MIS-C dEF) and MIS-C with preserved ejection fraction (MIS-C pEF). Global longitudinal strain (GLS) and global circumferential strain (GCS) were compared among MIS-C, Kawasaki disease (KD), and healthy children. Results In total, nine case-control studies were included, published between 2014 and 2021. These studies involved 107 patients with MIS-C, 188 patients with KD, and 356 healthy children. After Bayesian analysis, MIS-C dEF group was found to have a lower LVEF, higher GLS and GCS than the KD groups. Both MIS-C pEF and KD had similar GLS and GCS, which were higher than healthy controls. There was no difference of LVEF among MIS-C pEF, KD, and healthy controls. Conclusion MIS-C dEF was more severe than KD, both in LVEF and global myocardial strain. MIS-C pEF and KD were similar with mild impaired left ventricular myocardial strain compared with the healthy children. Global myocardial strain may be a monitoring index for MIS-C.

VOC screening from 16 fully vaccinated HCPs identified 6 (38%) harboring N501Y and 1 (6%) with E484K polymorphisms; concurrent non-vaccinated samples was 37% (523/1404) and 20% (284/1394), respectively. There was an upward trend from January to April for E484K/Q (3% to 26%) and N501Y (1% to 49%). WGS analysis from vaccinated and non-vaccinated individuals indicated highly congruent phylogenies. We did not detect an increased frequency of any RBD/NTD polymorphism between groups (P>0.05). Our results support robust protection by vaccination, particularly among recipients of both doses. Despite VOCs accounting for over 40% of SARS-CoV-2 from fully vaccinated individuals, the genomic diversity appears to proportionally represent those among non-vaccinated populations.",,2021,secondary,doi:10.1101/2021.06.30.21259761,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2021.06.30.21259761,
doi:10.7150/thno.74428,DNA aptamers inhibit SARS-CoV-2 spike-protein binding to hACE2 by an RBD- independent or dependent approach,"Objective: Nobody knows when the COVID-19 pandemic will end or when and where the next coronavirus will outbreak. Therefore, it is still necessary to develop SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors for different variants or even the new coronavirus. Since SARS-CoV-2 uses its surface spike-protein to recognize hACE2, mediating its entry into cells, ligands that can specifically recognize the spike-protein have the potential to prevent infection. Methods: We have recently discovered DNA aptamers against the S2-domain of the WT spike-protein by exploiting the selection process called SELEX. After optimization, among all candidates, the aptamer S2A2C1 has the shortest sequence and the best binding affinity toward the S2-protein. More importantly, the S2A2C1 aptamer does not bind to the RBD of the spike-protein, but it efficiently blocks the spike-protein/hACE2 interaction, suggesting an RBD-independent inhibition approach. To further improve its performance, we conjugated the S2A2C1 aptamer with a reported anti-RBD aptamer, S1B6C3, using various linkers and constructed hetero-bivalent fusion aptamers. Binding affinities of mono and fusion aptamers against the spike-proteins were measured. The inhibition efficacies of mono and fusion aptamers to prevent the hACE2/spike-protein interaction were determined using ELISA. Results: Anti-spike-protein aptamers, including S2A2C1 and S1B6C3-A5-S2A2C1, maintained high binding affinity toward the WT, Delta, and Omicron spike-proteins and high inhibition efficacies to prevent them from binding to hACE2, rendering them well-suited as diagnostic and therapeutic molecular tools to target SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. Conclusions: Overall, we discovered the anti-S2 aptamer, S2A2C1, which inhibits the hACE2/spike-protein interaction via an RBD-independent approach. The anti-S2 and anti-RBD aptamers were conjugated to obtain the fusion aptamer, S1B6C3-A5-S2A2C1, which recognizes the spike-protein by an RBD-dependent approach. Our strategies, which discovered aptamer inhibitors targeting the highly conserved S2-protein, as well as the design of fusion aptamers, can be used to target new coronaviruses as they emerge.",Theranostics,2022,secondary,doi:10.7150/thno.74428,35910791,9330529,https://doi.org/doi:10.7150/thno.74428,

Nevertheless, in case more antiviral mAbs will be authorized in the future, it is relevant to understand how frequently treatment-emergent resistance has emerged so far, under different combinations and in different patient subgroups. We report the results of a systematic review of the medical literature for case reports and case series for treatment-emergent immune escape, which is defined as emergence of a resistance-driving mutation in at least 20% of sequences in a given host at a given timepoint. We identified 31 publications detailing 201 cases that included different variants of concern (VOC) and found that the incidence of treatment emergent-resistance ranged from 10% to 50%. Most of the treatment-emergent resistance events occurred in immunocompromised patients. Interestingly, resistance also emerged against cocktails of two mAbs, albeit at lower frequencies. The heterogenous therapeutic management of those cases doesn't allow inferences about the clinical outcome in patients with treatment-emergent resistance. Furthermore, we noted a temporal correlation between the introduction of mAb therapies and a subsequent increase in SARS-CoV-2 sequences across the globe carrying mutations conferring resistance to that mAb, raising concern as to whether these had originated in mAb-treated individuals. Our findings confirm that treatment-emergent immune escape to anti-Spike mAbs represents a frequent and concerning phenomenon and suggests that these are associated with mAb use in immunosuppressed hosts.",Drug resistance updates : reviews and commentaries in antimicrobial and anticancer chemotherapy,2023,secondary,doi:10.1101/2023.03.02.23286677,37572569,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2023.03.02.23286677,

doi:10.1021/acs.analchem.2c04709,T-Shaped Aptamer-Based LSPR Biosensor Using Ω-Shaped Fiber Optic for Rapid Detection of SARS-CoV-2,"SARS-CoV-2, especially the variant strains, is rapidly spreading around the world. Rapid detection methods for the virus are crucial for controlling the COVID-19 epidemic. Herein, a localized surface plasmonic resonance (LSPR) biosensor based on Ω-shaped fiber optic (Ω-FO) was developed for dual assays of SARS-CoV-2 monitoring. Due to its strong ability to control the orientation and density, a new T-shaped aptamer exhibits enhanced binding affinity toward N proteins. After being combined on the fiber optic surface, the T-shaped aptamer sensitively captured N proteins of SARS-CoV-2 for a direct assay. Further, core–shell structured gold/silver nanoparticles functionalized with a T-shaped aptamer (apt-Ag@AuNPs) can amplify the signal of N protein detection for a sandwich assay. The real-time analytical feature of the dual assays endows time-dependent sensitivity enhancement behavior, which provides a guideline to save analytical time. With those characteristics, the LSPR biosensor has been successfully used to rapidly identify 39 healthy volunteers and 39 COVID-19 patients infected with the ancestral or variant SARS-CoV-2. With the help of simple pretreatment, we obtain a true negative rate of 100% and a true positive rate of 92.3% with a short analysis time of 45 min using the direct assay. Further, the LSPR biosensor could also broaden the detection application range to the surface of cold-chain foods using a sandwich assay. Thus, the LSPR biosensor based on Ω-FO was demonstrated to have broad application potential to detect SARS-CoV-2 rapidly.",Analytical Chemistry,2022,secondary,doi:10.1021/acs.analchem.2c04709,36580626,9843628,https://doi.org/doi:10.1021/acs.analchem.2c04709,

Early and precise detection of the virus is vital for effective diagnosis and treatment. Various testing kits and assays, including nucleic acid detection methods, antigen tests, serological tests, and enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), have been implemented or are being explored to detect the virus and/or characterize cellular and antibody responses to the infection. However, these approaches have inherent drawbacks such as nonspecificity, high cost, are characterized by long turnaround times for test results, and can be labor‐intensive. Also, the circulating SARS‐COV‐2 variant of concerns, reduced antibody sensitivity and/or neutralization, and possible antibody‐dependent enhancement (ADE) have warranted the search for alternative potent therapeutics. Aptamers, which are single‐stranded oligonucleotides, generated artificially by SELEX (Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment) may offer the capacity to generate high‐affinity neutralizers and/or bioprobes for monitoring relevant SARS‐COV‐2 and COVID‐19 biomarkers. This article reviews and discusses the prospects of implementing aptamers for rapid point‐of‐care detection and treatment of SARS‐COV‐2. We highlight other SARS‐COV‐2 targets (N protein, spike protein stem‐helix), SELEX augmented with competition assays and in silico technologies for rapid discovery and isolation of theranostic aptamers against COVID‐19 and future pandemics. It further provides an overview on site‐specific bioconjugation approaches, customizable molecular scaffolding strategies, and nanotechnology platforms to engineer these aptamers into ultrapotent blockers, multivalent therapeutics, and vaccines to boost both humoral and cellular immunity against the virus.

These peptides are present in all kingdoms of life, but especially in microorganisms, having multiple origins in diverse taxa. To date, there has been no global study on the diversity of antimicrobial peptides, the hosts in which these occur, and the potential for resistance to these agents. Here, we investigated the diversity and number of antimicrobial peptides in four main habitats (aquatic, terrestrial, human, and engineered) by analyzing 52,515 metagenome-assembled genomes. The number of antimicrobial peptides was higher in the human gut microbiome than in other habitats, and most hosts of antimicrobial peptides were habitat-specific. The relative abundance of genes that confer resistance to antimicrobial peptides varied between habitats and was generally low, except for the built environment and on human skin. The horizontal transfer of potential resistance genes among these habitats was probably constrained by ecological barriers. We systematically quantified the risk of each resistance determinant to human health and found that nearly half of them pose a threat, especially those that confer resistance to multiple AMPs and polymyxin B.

doi:10.1080/07853890.2023.2264315,Serum amyloid A as a biomarker for immunoglobulin resistance in Kawasaki disease.,"BACKGROUND
Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) resistance is of prime importance in Kawasaki disease (KD). In this study, we examined the value and mechanism of serum amyloid A (SAA) level in predicting IVIG resistance in patients with KD.


METHODS
SAA levels were measured in 497 consecutive patients with KD before IVIG therapy in the training set. The patients were divided into two groups (IVIG-responsive and IVIG-resistant) according to the American Heart Association (AHA) definition of IVIG resistance. Demographic, echocardiographic, and laboratory data were also retrospectively analyzed and tabulated to predict IVIG resistance. The predictive value of SAA was validated on test sets of prospective data. Cytokine microarrays were analyzed from 4 patients with resistant to IVIG, 4 patients with responsive to IVIG and 4 healthy volunteers.


RESULTS
During the training set, 409 patients with KD were enrolled, of whom 43 (10.5%) were resistant to initial IVIG treatment and 47 (11.49%) had coronary artery lesions (CALs). Serum levels of SAA were higher in the IVIG resistant group compared to the IVIG responsive group, (380.00 [204.40-547.25] vs 230.85 [105.40-490.00] mg/L; p = .008). The values of total bilirubin, C-reactive protein, neutrophils, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, interleukin-6(IL-6), and procalcitonin were significantly higher in the IVIG-resistant group than in the IVIG-responsive group (p < .05); however, the lymphocytes, platelets, serum sodium levels, and duration of fever before IVIG therapy were significantly lower (p < .05). There was no significant difference in SAA levels between patients with KD with and without CALs. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that SAA (p = .008), neutrophils (p < .001), total bilirubin (p = .001), platelet count (p = .004), and serum sodium level (p = .019) were independent factors influencing IVIG resistance. The optimal cutoff value of SAA for IVIG resistance prediction was 252.45 mg/L, with a corresponding clinical sensitivity of 69.8% and specificity of 54.4%. Based on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses, the area under the curve (AUC) of combined detection with these five indicators was 0.800, clinical sensitivity was 69.8%, and specificity was 76.2%. In the prospective data, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of SAA for identifying IVIG resistance KD were 77.8%,69.0%, and 70.0%, respectively. Compared with IVIG- responsive group and healthy children, the levels of IL-6 was upregulated significantly in IVIG-resistant group through cytokine microarrays.


CONCLUSIONS
SAA may be a potential biomarker for predicting IVIG responsiveness to KD, Combined detection of SAA levels, total bilirubin, neutrophil count, platelet count, and serum sodium levels is superior to that of any other single indicator for predicting IVIG resistance in KD. And elevated SAA may accompany with IL-6 in KD patients, its use in clinical practice may be helpful for treatment management.",Annals of medicine,2023,secondary,doi:10.1080/07853890.2023.2264315,37870383,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1080/07853890.2023.2264315,

AIM To determine whether the age-adjusted N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) value (Z-log-NT-proBNP) is associated with severe MIS-C and myocardial dysfunction. METHODS A retrospective study was conducted which included children with MIS-C managed at our institution between April 1, 2020, and February 28, 2022. We divided the population into groups depending on severity based on pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission. We compared Z-log-NT-proBNP values across these groups and analyzed Z-log-NT-proBNP dynamics during the one-month follow-up. RESULTS We included 17 participants [median age 3 (2-9) years] and seven (41%) required PICU admission. All (100%) of these cases presented very high (Z-log > 4) levels of NT-proBNP at the time of admission compared to only 5 (50%) patients with non-severe MIS-C (P = 0.025). NT-proBNP was significantly correlated with high-sensitive Troponin I levels (P = 0.045), Ross modified score (P = 0.003) and left ventricle ejection fraction (P = 0.021).

The multicentric, observational and prospective SENCOVAC study aims to describe the humoral response and safety of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in CKD patients. Safety and immediate humoral response results are reported here. Methods Four cohorts of patients were included: kidney transplant (KT) recipients, haemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis (PD) and non-dialysis CKD patients from 50 Spanish centres. Adverse events after vaccine doses were recorded. At baseline and on day 28 after the last vaccine dose, anti-Spike antibodies were measured and compared between cohorts. Factors associated with development of anti-Spike antibodies were analyzed. Results 1746 participants were recruited: 1116 HD, 171 PD, 176 non-dialysis CKD patients and 283 KT recipients. Most patients (98%) received mRNA vaccines. At least one vaccine reaction developed after the first dose in 763 (53.5%) and after the second dose in 741 (54.5%) of patients. Anti-Spike antibodies were measured in the first 301 patients. At 28 days, 95% of patients had developed antibodies: 79% of KT, 98% of HD, 99% of PD and 100% of non-dialysis CKD patients (p<0.001). In a multivariate adjusted analysis, absence of an antibody response was independently associated to KT (OR 20.56, p = 0.001) and to BNT162b2 vaccine (OR 6.03, p = 0.023). Conclusion The rate of anti-Spike antibody development after vaccination in KT patients was low but in other CKD patients it approached 100%; suggesting that KT patients require persistent isolation measures and booster doses of a Covid-19 vaccine.

doi:10.3389/fgene.2022.891418,A Bioinformatics Approach to Investigate Structural and Non-Structural Proteins in Human Coronaviruses,"Recent studies confirmed that people unexposed to SARS-CoV-2 have preexisting reactivity, probably due to previous exposure to widely circulating common cold coronaviruses. Such preexistent reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 comes from memory T cells that can specifically recognize a SARS-CoV-2 epitope of structural and non-structural proteins and the homologous epitopes from common cold coronaviruses. Therefore, it is important to understand the SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactivity by investigating these protein sequence similarities with those of different circulating coronaviruses. In addition, the emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants lead to an intense interest in whether mutations in proteins (especially in the spike) could potentially compromise vaccine effectiveness. Since it is not clear that the differences in clinical outcomes are caused by common cold coronaviruses, a deeper investigation on cross-reactive T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is crucial to examine the differential COVID-19 symptoms and vaccine performance. Therefore, the present study can be a starting point for further research on cross-reactive T cell recognition between circulating common cold coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2, including the most recent variants Delta and Omicron.

To address this challenge, we conducted a field trial within the University of Tennessee residence halls, employing different composite sampling modes that encompassed different time intervals (1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, and 24 h) across various time windows (morning, afternoon, evening, and late-night). Our primary objective was to identify the optimal approach for generating representative composite samples of SARS-CoV-2 from raw wastewater. Utilizing reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, we quantified the levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) RNA in raw sewage. Our findings consistently demonstrated that PMMoV RNA, an indicator virus of human fecal contamination in water environment, exhibited higher abundance and lower variability compared to pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Significantly, both SARS-CoV-2 and PMMoV RNA exhibited greater variability in 1 h individual composite samples throughout the entire sampling period, contrasting with the stability observed in other time-based composite samples. Through a comprehensive analysis of various composite sampling modes using the Quade Nonparametric ANCOVA test with date, PMMoV concentration and site as covariates, we concluded that employing a composite sampler during a focused 6 h morning window for pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 RNA is a pragmatic and cost-effective strategy for achieving representative composite samples within a single day in wastewater-based epidemiology applications.

Notably, the integration of huge amount of RNA-seq with other omic data sets in the model plants and major crop species have facilitated plant regulomics, while the RNA-seq analysis has still been primarily used for differential expression analysis in many less-studied plant species. To unleash the analytical power of RNA-seq in plant species, especially less-studied species and biomass crops, we summarize recent achievements of RNA-seq analysis in the major plant species and representative tools in the four types of application: (1) transcriptome assembly, (2) construction of expression atlas, (3) network analysis, and (4) structural alteration. We emphasize the importance of expression atlas, coexpression networks and predictions of gene regulatory relationships in moving plant transcriptomes toward regulomics, an omic view of genome-wide transcription regulation. We highlight what can be achieved in plant research with RNA-seq by introducing a list of representative RNA-seq analysis tools and resources that are developed for certain minor species or suitable for the analysis without species limitation. In summary, we provide an updated digest on RNA-seq tools, resources and the diverse applications for plant research, and our perspective on the power and challenges of short-read RNA-seq analysis from a regulomic point view.

Several primer schemes have been developed to sequence the ∼30,000 nucleotide SARS-CoV-2 genome that use a multiplex PCR approach to amplify cDNA copies of the viral genomic RNA. Midnight primers and ARTIC V4.1 primers are the most popular primer schemes that can amplify segments of SARS-CoV-2 (400 bp and 1200 bp, respectively) tiled across the viral RNA genome. Mutations within primer binding sites and primer-primer interactions can result in amplicon dropouts and coverage bias, yielding low-quality genomes with ‘Ns’ inserted in the missing amplicon regions, causing inaccurate lineage assignments, and making it challenging to monitor lineage-specific mutations in Variants of Concern (VoCs). This study uses seven long-range PCR primers with an amplicon size of ∼4500 bp to tile across the complete SARS-CoV-2 genome. One of these regions includes the full-length S-gene by using a set of flanking primers.

Pooling of SARS-CoV-2 tests is increasing in popularity, due to its high testing throughput. A popular pooling scheme is Dorfman pooling: test N individuals simultaneously, if the test is positive, each individual is then tested separately; otherwise, all are declared negative. Most analyses of the error rates of pooling schemes assume that including more than a single infected sample in a pooled test does not increase the probability of a positive outcome. We challenge this assumption with experimental data and suggest a novel and parsimonious probabilistic model for the outcomes of pooled tests. As an application, we analyse the false-negative rate (i.e. the probability of a negative result for an infected individual) of Dorfman pooling. We show that the false-negative rates under Dorfman pooling increase when the prevalence of infection decreases. However, low infection prevalence is exactly the condition when Dorfman pooling achieves highest throughput efficiency.

We introduce Kawarabi, as a multicenter research collaborative effort dedicated to improving diagnosis, care, and outcome of children and adults with KD in the Arab world. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there emerged a new multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children; a disease similar to KD. This highlighted the challenges that Arab physicians face in diagnosing and managing children with KD and KD-like illnesses. Kawarabi brings together experts in North America and Arab nations to study this family of diseases in a not-for-profit, voluntary scientific collaborative setting. Bylaws addressing the vision, objectives, structure, and governance of Kawarabi were established, and vetted by the 45 organizing members in 2021. An initial scientific publication showed evidence of a decreased level of awareness of the disease in the general population, as well as the lack of access to resources available for physicians caring for children with KD in Arab countries. Kawarabi has since held several educational webinars and an inaugural yearly meeting. The groundwork for future initiatives targeted at increasing awareness and understanding of the management and the long-term outcomes of children with KD in the region was established. Data on KD in the Arab world are lacking. Kawarabi is a multicenter research collaborative organization that has the unique resources, diversified ethnic makeup, and energy, to accomplish significant advances in our understanding and management of KD and its variants.",World journal for pediatric & congenital heart surgery,2023,secondary,doi:10.1177/21501351231205570,37981829,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1177/21501351231205570,

Once deployed, ML models are subject to performance issues, such as those related to changes in data (drift). This type of issue has prompted efforts in model analysis and maintenance, as well as in continual learning, which seeks the ability to continuously learn from a (continuous) stream of data. Therefore, it's important to understand and develop methodologies that can be used to evaluate ML models, making their use in real-world environments feasible. Amongst current areas of application for ML, one that stands out, in particular, is Machine Learning for Healthcare, especially in conjunction with Software for Decision Support of Medical Applications, which presents specific challenges for the evaluation and monitoring of models, particularly given that incorrect prediction or classification can lead to life-threatening situations.

doi:10.1080/21505594.2023.2242544,Pathogenicity and virulence of human adenovirus F41: Possible links to severe hepatitis in children,"ABSTRACT Over 100 human adenoviruses (HAdVs) have been isolated and allocated to seven species, A-G. Species F comprises two members-HAdV-F40 and HAdV-F41. As their primary site of infection is the gastrointestinal tract they have been termed, with species A, enteric adenoviruses. HAdV-F40 and HAdV-F41 are a common cause of gastroenteritis and diarrhoea in children. Partly because of difficulties in propagating the viruses in the laboratory, due to their restrictions on growth in many cell lines, our knowledge of the properties of individual viral proteins is limited. However, the structure of HAdV-F41 has recently been determined by cryo-electron microscopy. The overall structure is similar to those of HAdV-C5 and HAdV-D26 although with some differences. The sequence and arrangement of the hexon hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) and the arrangement of the C-terminal region of protein IX differ. Variations in the penton base and hexon HVR1 may play a role in facilitating infection of intestinal cells by HAdV-F41. A unique feature of HAdV-F40 and F41, among human adenoviruses, is the presence and expression of two fibre genes, giving long and short fibre proteins. This may also contribute to the tropism of these viruses. HAdV-F41 has been linked to a recent outbreak of severe acute hepatitis “of unknown origin” in young children. Further investigation has shown a very high prevalence of adeno-associated virus-2 in the liver and/or plasma of some cohorts of patients. These observations have proved controversial as HAdV-F41 had not been reported to infect the liver and AAV-2 has generally been considered harmless.",Virulence,2023,secondary,doi:10.1080/21505594.2023.2242544,37543996,10405776,https://doi.org/doi:10.1080/21505594.2023.2242544,

Our analysis revealed that though the number of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges remained the same, the binding affinity of B.1.620 for ACE2 was higher than that of the wild type, consequently increasing infectivity. Moreover, the stable dynamics and other features further justify the findings, corroborating the previous literature. Abstract Recently, a new variant, B.1620, with mutations (S477N-E484K) in the spike protein’s receptor-binding domain (RBD) has been reported in Europe. In order to design therapeutic strategies suitable for B.1.620, further studies are required. A detailed investigation of the structural features and variations caused by these substitutions, that is, a molecular level investigation, is essential to uncover the role of these changes. To determine whether and how the binding affinity of ACE2–RBD is affected, we used protein–protein docking and all-atom simulation approaches. Our analysis revealed that B.1.620 binds more strongly than the wild type and alters the hydrogen bonding network. The docking score for the wild type was reported to be −122.6 +/− 0.7 kcal/mol, while for B.1.620, the docking score was −124.9 +/− 3.8 kcal/mol. A comparative binding investigation showed that the wild-type complex has 11 hydrogen bonds and one salt bridge, while the B.1.620 complex has 14 hydrogen bonds and one salt bridge, among which most of the interactions are preserved between the wild type and B.1.620. A dynamic analysis of the two complexes revealed stable dynamics, which corroborated the global stability trend, compactness, and flexibility of the three essential loops, providing a better conformational optimization opportunity and binding. Furthermore, binding free energy revealed that the wild type had a total binding energy of −51.14 kcal/mol, while for B.1.628, the total binding energy was −68.25 kcal/mol. The current findings based on protein complex modeling and bio-simulation methods revealed the atomic features of the B.1.620 variant harboring S477N and E484K mutations in the RBD and the basis for infectivity. In conclusion, the current study presents distinguishing features of B.1.620, which can be used to design structure-based drugs against the B.1.620 variant.",Biology,2021,secondary,doi:10.3390/biology10121310,34943225,8698945,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/biology10121310,

Several immune-modulating risk factors can contribute to a more severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) course with increased morbidity and mortality. The comparatively rare post-infectious multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) can develop in formerly healthy individuals, with accelerated progression to life-threatening illness. A common trajectory of immune dysregulation forms a continuum of the COVID-19 spectrum and MIS; however, severity of COVID-19 or the development of MIS is dependent on distinct aetiological factors that produce variable host inflammatory responses to infection with different spatiotemporal manifestations, a comprehensive understanding of which is necessary to set better targeted therapeutic and preventative strategies for both.

In vivo library selection is an effective method for identifying constructs that exhibit desired distribution behavior; library variants can be selected based on their ability to localize to the tissue or compartment of interest despite complex physiological challenges. Here, we describe further development of an in vivo library selection platform based on self-assembling protein nanoparticles encapsulating their own mRNA genomes (synthetic nucleocapsids or synNCs). We tested two distinct libraries: a low-diversity library composed of synNC surface mutations (45 variants) and a high-diversity library composed of synNCs displaying miniproteins with binder-like properties (6.2 million variants). While we did not identify any variants from the low-diversity surface library that yielded therapeutically relevant changes in biodistribution, the high-diversity miniprotein display library yielded variants that shifted accumulation toward lungs or muscles in just two rounds of in vivo selection.

Recent analyses of accumulated data indicated that certain criteria from the 2020 CDC MIS-C case definition performed better than others in distinguishing MIS-C from other illnesses and that certain other criteria likely contributed to misclassification. To incorporate lessons learned from MIS-C surveillance and public health investigations and to improve feasibility of implementation by surveillance staff at state, local, territorial, and tribal health departments, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) and CDC developed a CSTE/CDC position statement (approved by CSTE in 2022) that includes an MIS-C surveillance case definition for voluntary reporting to CDC (effective January 1, 2023) This report summarizes the evidence and rationale supporting the components of the CSTE/CDC MIS-C surveillance case definition and describes the methods used to develop the definition. These methods included convening MIS-C clinical experts (i.e., consultants) regarding identification of MIS-C and its distinction from other pediatric conditions, a review of available literature comparing MIS-C phenotype with that of pediatric COVID-19 and other hyperinflammatory syndromes, and retrospective application of different criteria to data from MIS-C cases previously reported to CDC. The CSTE/CDC surveillance case definition for MIS-C includes four important changes, in comparison with the 2020 CDC MIS-C case definition. These changes are 1) no required duration of subjective or measured fever; 2) requirement of C-reactive protein ≥3.0 mg/dL to indicate systemic inflammation; 3) adjustments to criteria of organ system involvement to include addition of shock as a separate category and elimination of respiratory, neurologic, and renal criteria; and 4) new requirements on timing of positive SARS-CoV-2 laboratory testing relative to the MIS-C illness. Although MIS-C is not a nationally notifiable condition and reporting is voluntary, CSTE and CDC recommend that all states and territories report all cases meeting confirmed, probable, or suspect criteria of the CSTE/CDC MIS-C surveillance case definition beginning January 1, 2023, for cases with MIS-C illness onset on or after that date",MMWR Recommendations and Reports,2022,secondary,doi:10.15585/mmwr.rr7104a1,36520808,9762894,https://doi.org/doi:10.15585/mmwr.rr7104a1,

We report a case of full resolution of severe COVID-19 due to convalescent plasma transfusion in a patient with underlying multiple autoimmune syndrome. Following transfusion, the patient showed fever remission, improved respiratory status, and rapidly decreased viral burden in respiratory fluids and SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia. Longitudinal unbiased proteomic analysis of plasma and single-cell transcriptomics of peripheral blood cells conducted prior to and at multiple times after convalescent plasma transfusion identified the key biological processes associated with the transition from severe disease to disease-free state. These included (i) temporally ordered upward and downward changes in plasma proteins reestablishing homeostasis and (ii) post-transfusion disappearance of a particular subset of dysfunctional monocytes characterized by hyperactivated Interferon responses and decreased TNF- signaling.

The scientific community also needed to rapidly initiate basic, translational, clinical and epidemiological studies to understand the pathophysiology of this new family of viruses, which continues to evolve with the emergence of new genetic variants. One of the earliest clinical observations that provided a framework for the research was the finding that, in contrast to most other respiratory viruses, children developed less severe acute and post-acute disease compared to adults. Although the clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection changed with each new wave of the pandemic, which was dominated by evolving viral variants, the differences in severity between children and adults persisted. Comparative immunologic studies have shown that children mount a more vigorous local innate response characterized by the activation of interferon pathways and recruitment of innate cells to the mucosa, which may mitigate against the hyperinflammatory adaptive response and systemic cytokine release that likely contributed to more severe outcomes including acute respiratory distress syndrome in adults.

doi:10.1021/acs.jpclett.1c03380,Mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 Evolution Revealing Vaccine-Resistant Mutations in Europe and America,"The importance of understanding SARS-CoV-2 evolution cannot be overlooked. Recent studies confirm that natural selection is the dominating mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 evolution, which favors mutations that strengthen viral infectivity. Here, we demonstrate that vaccine-breakthrough or antibody-resistant mutations provide a new mechanism of viral evolution. Specifically, vaccine-resistant mutation Y449S in the spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain, which occurred in co-mutations Y449S and N501Y, has reduced infectivity compared to that of the original SARS-CoV-2 but can disrupt existing antibodies that neutralize the virus. By tracking the evolutionary trajectories of vaccine-resistant mutations in more than 2.2 million SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we reveal that the occurrence and frequency of vaccine-resistant mutations correlate strongly with the vaccination rates in Europe and America. We anticipate that as a complementary transmission pathway, vaccine-breakthrough or antibody-resistant mutations, like those in Omicron, will become a dominating mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 evolution when most of the world’s population is either vaccinated or infected.

This soft‐hard tissue interface is formed by the direct insertion of fibrous ligaments into the bone tissue. It differs from the unique four‐layer structure of the fibrocartilage interface. This interface is formed by a combination of physical, chemical, and biological factors. The physiological functions of this interface are regulated by different signaling pathways. The unique structure of this soft‐hard tissue interface has inspired scientists to construct biomimetic gradient structures. These biomimetic systems include nanofiber scaffolds, cell sheets, and hydrogels. Exploring methods to repair this soft‐hard tissue interface can help solve clinically unresolved problems. The present review examines the structure of the soft‐hard tissue interface of the periodontium and the factors that influence the development of this interface.

During the passage of the virus through affected populations, it has undergone mutations, some of which have recently been linked with increased viral load and prognostic complexities. Several of these variants are point mutations that are difficult to diagnose using the gold standard quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) method and necessitates widespread sequencing which is expensive, has long turn-around times, and requires high viral load for calling mutations accurately. Here, we repurpose the high specificity of Francisella novicida Cas9 (FnCas9) to identify mismatches in the target for developing a lateral flow assay that can be successfully adapted for the simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as for detecting point mutations in the sequence of the virus obtained from patient samples. We report the detection of the S gene mutation N501Y (present across multiple variant lineages of SARS-CoV-2) within an hour using lateral flow paper strip chemistry. The results were corroborated using deep sequencing on multiple wild-type (n = 37) and mutant (n = 22) virus infected patient samples with a sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 97%.

Therefore, developing highly reliable and sensitive point-of-care testing (POCT) for detecting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a priority. Among all available POCTs, the lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA, also known as immunochromatography) has proved to be effective due to its accuracy, portability, convenience, and speed. In areas with a scarcity of laboratory resources and medical personnel, the LFIA provides an affordable option for the diagnosis of COVID-19. This review offers a comprehensive overview of methods for improving the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection using immunochromatography based on nanotechnology, sorted according to the different detection targets (antigens, antibodies, and nucleic acids). It also looks into the performance and properties of the various sensitivity enhancement strategies, before delving into the remaining challenges in COVID-19 diagnosis through LFIA.

In this study, we investigated 129 RNA-seq data sets and 6928 consensus genomes to contrast the intra-host and inter-host diversity of SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses yielded three major observations. First, the mutational profile of SARS-CoV-2 highlights intra-host single nucleotide variant (iSNV) and SNP similarity, albeit with differences in C > U changes. Second, iSNV and SNP patterns in SARS-CoV-2 are more similar to MERS-CoV than SARS-CoV-1. Third, a significant fraction of insertions and deletions contribute to the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2.

But how do severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections afflict children? The COVID-19 pandemic has yielded many surprises, not least that children generally develop less severe disease than older adults, which is unusual for a respiratory disease. However, some children can develop serious complications from COVID-19, such as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) and Long Covid, even after mild or asymptomatic COVID-19. Why this occurs in some and not others is an important question. Moreover, when children do contract COVID-19, understanding their role in transmission, especially in schools and at home, is crucial to ensuring effective mitigation measures. Therefore, in addition to nonpharmaceutical interventions, such as improved ventilation, there is a strong case to vaccinate children so as to reduce possible long-term effects from infection and to decrease transmission. But questions remain about whether vaccination might skew immune responses to variants in the long term. As the experts discuss below, more is being learned about these important issues, but much more research is needed to understand the long-term effects of COVID-19 in children.",Science,2022,secondary,doi:10.1126/science.ade1675,36074833,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1126/science.ade1675,

Here, we addressed this question by comparing two populations of marine bacteria and their phages collected during a time series sampling in an oyster farm. Vibrio crassostreae reproduces more specifically in oysters. This population is genetically structured into clades of near clonal strains favoring infection by closely related phages and leading to a modular structure of the phage-bacterial infection network. Vibrio chagasii, on the other hand, blooms in the water column from where it can colonize oysters via filter-feeding. We found higher phage predation pressure on V. chagasii that did not result from a broader host range of the phages but rather from a greater burst size generating more infectious particles in the environment. We showed that contrasting patterns of genetic diversity for host and phage lead to different infection network architectures.

Accounting for wastewater dilution is essential to properly quantify wastewater particle loads, whether these are molecular fragments of SARS-CoV-2, or other substances of interest such as illicit drugs or microplastics. This paper presents a novel method for obtaining real-time estimates of wastewater dilution and total daily volume through wastewater treatment works, namely when flow data is not available or unreliable. The approach considers the levels of several physico-chemical markers (ammonia, electrical conductivity, and orthophosphate) in the wastewater against their dry-weather levels. Using high-resolution data from the national Wastewater Surveillance Programme of Wales, we illustrate how the method is robust to spikes in markers and can recover peaks in wastewater flow measurements that may have been capped by hydraulic relief valves. We show the method proves effective in normalising SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in wastewater samples and discuss other applications for this method, looking at wastewater surveillance as a vital tool to monitor both human and environmental health.",Water,2022,secondary,doi:10.3390/w14182885,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/w14182885,
doi:10.1126/science.abo3627,Inborn errors of OAS–RNase L in SARS-CoV-2–related multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children,"Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a rare and severe condition that follows benign COVID-19. We report autosomal recessive deficiencies of OAS1, OAS2, or RNASEL in five unrelated children with MIS-C. The cytosolic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)–sensing OAS1 and OAS2 generate 2′-5′-linked oligoadenylates (2-5A) that activate the single-stranded RNA–degrading ribonuclease L (RNase L). Monocytic cell lines and primary myeloid cells with OAS1, OAS2, or RNase L deficiencies produce excessive amounts of inflammatory cytokines upon dsRNA or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) stimulation. Exogenous 2-5A suppresses cytokine production in OAS1-deficient but not RNase L–deficient cells. Cytokine production in RNase L–deficient cells is impaired by MDA5 or RIG-I deficiency and abolished by mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) deficiency. Recessive OAS–RNase L deficiencies in these patients unleash the production of SARS-CoV-2–triggered, MAVS-mediated inflammatory cytokines by mononuclear phagocytes, thereby underlying MIS-C. Description Is the OAS–RNase L pathway the “MIS-C”ing link? Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a severe complication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that affects one in 10,000 infected children. MIS-C is reminiscent of Kawasaki disease and its etiology remains unknown. Lee et al. performed whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing on a cohort of MIS-C patients and uncovered autosomal-recessive deficiencies of OAS1, OAS2, or RNASEL in around 1% of the cohort (see the Perspective by Brodin). These genes are components of a signaling pathway that suppresses inflammation in double-stranded RNA–stimulated mononuclear phagocytes. Thus, single-gene recessive inborn errors of the OAS–RNase L pathway can result in uncontrolled inflammatory cytokine production by mononuclear phagocytes after SARS-CoV-2 infection, potentially explaining the origins of MIS-C in some children. —STS Autosomal-recessive deficits in RNA sensing can result in SARS-CoV-2–triggered Kawasaki-like disease. INTRODUCTION Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a severe, unexplained complication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection with an estimated prevalence of ~1 per 10,000 infected children. It typically occurs 4 weeks after infection, without hypoxemic pneumonia. Affected children present with fever, rash, abdominal pain, myocarditis, and other clinical features reminiscent of Kawasaki disease, including lymphadenopathy, coronary aneurysm, and high levels of biological markers of acute inflammation. Sustained monocyte activation is consistently reported as a key immunological feature of MIS-C. A more specific immunological abnormality is the polyclonal expansion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells bearing the T cell receptor Vβ21.3. The root cause of MIS-C and its immunological and clinical features remains unknown. RATIONALE We hypothesized that monogenic inborn errors of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 may underlie MIS-C in some children. We further hypothesized that the identification of these inborn errors would provide insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying its immunological and clinical phenotypes. Finally, we hypothesized that a genetic and mechanistic understanding of a few patients would provide a proof of principle that would facilitate studies in other patients. We performed whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing on 558 internationally recruited patients with MIS-C (aged 3 months to 19 years). We searched for rare nonsynonymous biallelic variants of protein-coding genes, testing a hypothesis of genetic homogeneity. RESULTS We found autosomal recessive deficiencies of OAS1 (2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase 1), OAS2, or RNase L (ribonuclease L) in five unrelated children of four different ancestries with MIS-C (~1% of our cohort). There were no similar defects in a cohort of 1288 individuals (aged 6 months to 99 years) with asymptomatic or mild infection (P = 0.001) or 334 young patients (aged 0 to 21 years) with asymptomatic or mild infection or COVID-19 pneumonia (P = 0.046). The estimated cumulative frequency of these defects in the general population was ~0.00013. The type I interferon (IFN)–inducible double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)–sensing proteins OAS1 and OAS2 generate 2′-5′-linked oligoadenylates (2-5A), which activate the antiviral single-stranded RNA (ssRNA)–degrading RNase L, particularly in mononuclear phagocytes. Consistent with the absence of pneumonia in these patients, epithelial cells and fibroblasts defective for this pathway restricted SARS-CoV-2 normally. This contrasted with interferon alpha and beta receptor subunit 1 (IFNAR1)–deficient cells from patients prone to hypoxemic pneumonia without MIS-C. Monocytic cell lines with genetic deficiencies of OAS1, OAS2, or RNase L displayed excessive inflammatory cytokine production in response to intracellular dsRNA. Cytokine production by RNase L–deficient cells was impaired by melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) or retinoic acid–inducible gene I (RIG-I) deficiency and abolished by mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) deficiency. Exogenous 2-5A suppressed inflammatory responses to these stimuli in control and OAS1-deficient cells but not in RNase L–deficient cells. Finally, monocytic cell lines, primary monocytes, and monocyte-derived dendritic cells with genetic deficiencies of OAS1, OAS2, or RNase L displayed exaggerated inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV-2–infected cells and their RNA. CONCLUSION We report autosomal recessive deficiencies of OAS1, OAS2, or RNase L in ∼1% of an international cohort of MIS-C patients. The cytosolic OAS–RNase L pathway suppresses RIG-I/MDA5–MAVS–mediated inflammation in dsRNA-stimulated mononuclear phagocytes. Single-gene recessive inborn errors of the OAS–RNase L pathway unleash the production of SARS-CoV-2–triggered inflammatory cytokines by mononuclear phagocytes, thereby underlying MIS-C. OAS–RNase L deficiency in MIS-C. dsRNAs from SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV-2–permissive cells engulfed by mononuclear phagocytes simultaneously activate the RIG-I/MDA5–MAVS pathway, inducing inflammatory cytokine production, and the OAS–RNase L pathway, exerting posttranscriptional control over inflammatory cytokine production. OAS–RNase L deficiency results in excessive inflammatory cytokine production by myeloid cells, triggering MIS-C, including lymphoid cell activation and multiple tissue lesions.

These observations, along with evolutionary considerations on viral fitness, raised the more general puzzling hypothesis that, beyond documented sources in human genetics, aging in our species may also depend on virally encoded interactions distorting our aging to the benefits of diverse viruses. Accordingly, we designed systematic network–based analyses of the human and viral protein interactomes, which unraveled dozens of viruses encoding proteins experimentally demonstrated to interact with proteins from pathways associated with human aging, including cellular senescence. We further corroborated our predictions that specific viruses interfere with human aging using published experimental evidence and transcriptomic data; identifying influenza A virus (subtype H1N1) as a major candidate age distorter, notably through manipulation of cellular senescence. By providing original evidence that viruses may convergently contribute to the evolution of numerous age-associated pathways through co-evolution, our network-based and bipartite network–based methodologies support an ecosystemic study of aging, also searching for genetic causes of aging outside a focal aging species. Our findings, predicting age distorters and targets for anti-aging therapies among human viruses, could have fundamental and practical implications for evolutionary biology, aging study, virology, medicine, and demography.",Molecular Biology and Evolution,2023,secondary,doi:10.1093/molbev/msad012,36649176,9897028,https://doi.org/doi:10.1093/molbev/msad012,

doi:10.3389/fmed.2022.849217,The Biological Functions and Clinical Significance of SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Corcern,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is continuing to evolve, emerging novel variants with spike protein mutations. Although most mutations emerged in the SARS-CoV-2 genome are neutral or mildly deleterious, a small number of mutations can affect virus phenotype that confers the virus a fitness advantage. These mutations can enhance viral replication, raise the risk of reinfection and blunt the potency of neutralizing antibodies triggered by previous infection and vaccination. Since December 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 has emerged five quickly spreading strains, designated variants of concern (VOCs), including the Alpha (B.1.1.7) variant, the Beta (B.1.351) variant, the Gamma (P.1) variant, the Delta (B.1.617.2) variant and the Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant. These variants have a high number of the mutations in the spike protein that promotes viral cell entry through the angiotensin-converting enzyme -2 (ACE2). Mutations that have arisen in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein are of great concern due to their potential to evade neutralizing antibodies triggered by previous infection and vaccines. The Alpha variant emerged in the United Kingdom in the second half of 2020 that has spread quickly globally and acquired the E484K mutation in the United Kingdom and the United States. The Beta and Gamma variants emerged in South Africa and Brazil, respectively, that have additional mutations at positions E484 and K417 in the RBD. SARS-CoV-2 variants containing the combination of N501Y, E484K, and K417N/T mutations exhibit remarkably decreased sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies mediated by vaccination or previous infection. The Gamma variant may result in more severe disease than other variants do even in convalescent individuals. The Delta variant emerged in India in December 2020 and has spread to many countries including the United States and the United Kingdom. The Delta variant has 8 mutations in the spike protein, some of which can influence immune responses to the key antigenic regions of RBD. In early November 2021, the Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant was first detected in Botswana and South Africa. The Omicron variant harbors more than 30 mutations in the spike protein, many of which are located within the RBD, which have been associated with increased transmissibility and immune evasion after previous infection and vaccination. Additionally, the Omicron variant contains 3 deletions and one insertion in the spike protein. Recently, the Omicron variant has been classified into three sublineages, including BA.1, BA.2, and BA.3, with strikingly different genetic characteristics. The Omicron BA.2 sublineage has different virological landscapes, such as transmissibility, pathogenicity and resistance to the vaccine-induced immunity compared to BA.1 and BA.3 sublineages. Mutations emerged in the RBD of the spike protein of VOCs increase viral replication, making the virus more infectious and more transmissible and enable the virus to evade vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibodies. Unfortunately, the emergence of novel SARS-CoV-2 VOCs has tempered early optimism regarding the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines. This review addresses the biological and clinical significance of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs and their impact on neutralizing antibodies mediated by existing COVID-19 vaccines.",Frontiers in Medicine,2022,secondary,doi:10.3389/fmed.2022.849217,35669924,9163346,https://doi.org/doi:10.3389/fmed.2022.849217,
doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1011348,Variant-specific introduction and dispersal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in New York City – from Alpha to Omicron,"Since the latter part of 2020, SARS-CoV-2 evolution has been characterised by the emergence of viral variants associated with distinct biological characteristics. While the main research focus has centred on the ability of new variants to increase in frequency and impact the effective reproductive number of the virus, less attention has been placed on their relative ability to establish transmission chains and to spread through a geographic area. Here, we describe a phylogeographic approach to estimate and compare the introduction and dispersal dynamics of the main SARS-CoV-2 variants – Alpha, Iota, Delta, and Omicron – that circulated in the New York City area between 2020 and 2022. Notably, our results indicate that Delta had a lower ability to establish sustained transmission chains in the NYC area and that Omicron (BA.1) was the variant fastest to disseminate across the study area. The analytical approach presented here complements non-spatially-explicit analytical approaches that seek a better understanding of the epidemiological differences that exist among successive SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.",PLOS Pathogens,2023,secondary,doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1011348,37071654,10180688,https://doi.org/doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1011348,

doi:10.3390/microorganisms11040904,A First Insight into the Microbial and Viral Communities of Comau Fjord—A Unique Human-Impacted Ecosystem in Patagonia (42° S),"While progress has been made in surveying the oceans to understand microbial and viral communities, the coastal ocean and, specifically, estuarine waters, where the effects of anthropogenic activity are greatest, remain partially understudied. The coastal waters of Northern Patagonia are of interest since this region experiences high-density salmon farming as well as other disturbances such as maritime transport of humans and cargo. Here, we hypothesized that viral and microbial communities from the Comau Fjord would be distinct from those collected in global surveys yet would have the distinctive features of microbes from coastal and temperate regions. We further hypothesized that microbial communities will be functionally enriched in antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in general and in those related to salmon farming in particular. Here, the analysis of metagenomes and viromes obtained for three surface water sites showed that the structure of the microbial communities was distinct in comparison to global surveys such as the Tara Ocean, though their composition converges with that of cosmopolitan marine microbes belonging to Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria. Similarly, viral communities were also divergent in structure and composition but matched known viral members from North America and the southern oceans. Microbial communities were functionally enriched in ARGs dominated by beta-lactams and tetracyclines, bacitracin, and the group macrolide–lincosamide–streptogramin (MLS) but were not different from other communities from the South Atlantic, South Pacific, and Southern Oceans. Similarly, viral communities were characterized by exhibiting protein clusters similar to those described globally (Tara Oceans Virome); however, Comau Fjord viromes displayed up to 50% uniqueness in their protein content. Altogether, our results indicate that microbial and viral communities from the Comau Fjord are a reservoir of untapped diversity and that, given the increasing anthropogenic impacts in the region, they warrant further study, specifically regarding resilience and resistance against antimicrobials and hydrocarbons.",Microorganisms,2023,secondary,doi:10.3390/microorganisms11040904,37110327,10143455,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/microorganisms11040904,

By screening monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) isolated from COVID-19-convalescent patients, we found one mAb, 2-36, with cross-neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV. We solved the cryo-EM structure of 2–36 in complex with SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV spike, revealing a highly conserved epitope in the receptor-binding domain (RBD). Antibody 2–36 neutralized not only all current circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants and SARS-COV, but also a panel of bat and pangolin sarbecoviruses that can use human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor. We selected 2-36-escape viruses in vitro and confirmed that K378 T in SARS-CoV-2 RBD led to viral resistance. Taken together, 2–36 represents a strategic reserve drug candidate for the prevention and treatment of possible diseases caused by pre-emergent SARS-related coronaviruses.

Their ability to selectively bind proteins has made these compounds very attractive and versatile tools, in both basic and applied sciences, to such an extent that they are considered an appealing alternative to antibodies. Here, by exhaustively surveying the content of the Protein Data Bank (PDB), we review the structural aspects of the protein–aptamer recognition process. As a result of three decades of structural studies, we identified 144 PDB entries containing atomic-level information on protein–aptamer complexes. Interestingly, we found a remarkable increase in the number of determined structures in the last two years as a consequence of the effective application of the cryo-electron microscopy technique to these systems. In the present paper, particular attention is devoted to the articulated architectures that protein–aptamer complexes may exhibit. Moreover, the molecular mechanism of the binding process was analyzed by collecting all available information on the structural transitions that aptamers undergo, from their protein-unbound to the protein-bound state. The contribution of computational approaches in this area is also highlighted.",International Journal of Molecular Sciences,2023,secondary,doi:10.3390/ijms242216318,38003510,10671752,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/ijms242216318,
doi:10.1039/d3nr01058a,Exhaustive classification and systematic free-energy profile study of single-stranded DNA inter-overhang migration.,"Migration of a short single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) between DNA overhangs is a basic molecular process that is widely used in dynamic DNA nanotechnology. The migration rate is sensitive to migration gaits, and limits the speed of dynamic DNA systems like DNA nanowalkers and other functional devices. Here, we identify and exhaustively classify all possible inter-overhang migration gaits of a ssDNA into only four categories based on their intrinsic symmetry. Using the oxDNA package, we conduct a systematic computational study for a typical migrator-overhang system to identify the lowest-energy pathway for all four migration categories. The one-dimensional free-energy profile along this pathway allows a parameter-free estimation of migration rates for all the four categories by the first passage time theory plus benchmarking from experimental rates available for one migration category. The obtained rates indicate a big room to improve DNA nanowalkers' speed above 1 μm per minute. The free-energy profile for each migration category possesses distinct and robust symmetric patterns, which largely decide local barriers, trapping states, and thereby a migration's rate-limiting processes and capacity for directional bias. This study thus provides a unified symmetry-based framework to analyze and optimize ssDNA migrations in kinetics, bias capacity, and structural design for better dynamic DNA nanotechnology.",Nanoscale,2023,secondary,doi:10.1039/d3nr01058a,37431227,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1039/d3nr01058a,

The aim of this retrospective cohort trial was to describe the initial clinical presentation, diagnostics, therapy and clinical outcome of paediatric patients with a diagnosis of PIMS-TS admitted to one of the 3 PICUs. All paediatric patients who were admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) during the study period were enrolled in the study. A total of 180 patients were analysed. The most common symptoms upon admission were fever (81.6%, n = 147), rash (70.6%, n = 127), conjunctivitis (68.9%, n = 124) and abdominal pain (51.1%, n = 92).

With the aim of enhancing knowledge about blending and masking mixture perceptions, we focused on structure-odor relationships by combining the classification and pharmacophore approaches. We built a dataset of about 5000 molecules and their related odors and reduced the multidimensional space defined by 1014 fingerprints representing the structures to a tridimensional 3D space using uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP). The self-organizing map (SOM) classification was then performed using the 3D coordinates in the UMAP space that defined specific clusters. We explored the allocating in these clusters of the components of two aroma mixtures: a blended mixture (red cordial (RC) mixture, 6 molecules) and a masking binary mixture (isoamyl acetate/whiskey-lactone [IA/WL]). Focusing on clusters containing the components of the mixtures, we looked at the odor notes carried by the molecules belonging to these clusters and also at their structural features by pharmacophore modeling (PHASE). The obtained pharmacophore models suggest that WL and IA could have a common binding site(s) at the peripheral level, but that would be excluded for the components of RC.

doi:10.1126/scitranslmed.abi9915,Antibodies elicited by mRNA-1273 vaccination bind more broadly to the receptor binding domain than do those from SARS-CoV-2 infection,"Deep mutational scanning shows that the mRNA-1273 RBD-binding antibody response is less affected by single viral mutations than the infection response. Binding Breadth Antibody responses elicited by natural infection or vaccination against the same target are known to differ. However, the extent to which antibody responses to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) differ between vaccination and infection has not been fully characterized. Here, Greaney et al. demonstrated that neutralizing antibodies elicited by immunization with the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine were more focused to the RBD than those elicited by natural infection. However, vaccination-elicited antibodies targeted a broader range of epitopes within the RBD than infection-elicited antibodies. These findings demonstrate that the type of exposure, including different types of vaccines or infection, can influence the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants with mutations in key antibody epitopes has raised concerns that antigenic evolution could erode adaptive immunity elicited by prior infection or vaccination. The susceptibility of immunity to viral evolution is shaped in part by the breadth of epitopes targeted by antibodies elicited by vaccination or natural infection. To investigate how human antibody responses to vaccines are influenced by viral mutations, we used deep mutational scanning to compare the specificity of polyclonal antibodies elicited by either two doses of the mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine or natural infection with SARS-CoV-2. The neutralizing activity of vaccine-elicited antibodies was more targeted to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein compared to antibodies elicited by natural infection. However, within the RBD, binding of vaccine-elicited antibodies was more broadly distributed across epitopes compared to infection-elicited antibodies. This greater binding breadth means that single RBD mutations have less impact on neutralization by vaccine sera compared to convalescent sera. Therefore, antibody immunity acquired by natural infection or different modes of vaccination may have a differing susceptibility to erosion by SARS-CoV-2 evolution.",Science Translational Medicine,2021,secondary,doi:10.1126/scitranslmed.abi9915,34103407,8369496,https://doi.org/doi:10.1126/scitranslmed.abi9915,

Tween 20-AuNPs are utilized as colorimetric probes and excellent fluorescent absorbers. The fluorescence of CdSe/ZnS QDs can be quenched efficiently by Tween 20-AuNPs via IFE. In the presence of D-penicillamine, D-penicillamine induces the aggregation of Tween 20-AuNPs and the fluorescent recovery of CdSe/ZnS QDs at high ionic strength. Upon addition of Cu2+, D-penicillamine tends to selectively chelate with Cu2+ and then forms the mixed-valence complexes, which consequently inhibits the aggregation of Tween 20-AuNPs and the fluorescent recovery. The dual-signal method is used to quantitatively detect trace Cu2+, with low detection limits of 0.57 μg/L and 0.36 μg/L for colorimetry and fluorescence, respectively. In addition, the proposed method using a portable spectrometer is applied to the detection of Cu2+ in water.

doi:10.2196/38386,The Pragmatic Return to Effective Dental Infection Control Through Triage and Testing (PREDICT) Study: Protocol for a Prospective Clinical Study in the National Dental Practice–Based Research Network,"Background Dental practice has been greatly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. As SARS-CoV-2 infection is transmitted by respiratory fluids, dental practice techniques, which include aerosol-generating procedures, can increase the risk of transmission causing heightened safety concerns for both dental health care workers (DHCWs) and patients. These concerns have resulted in the reduction in patient volume and the available workforce within dental practices across the United States. Standardized methods for COVID-19 triage and testing may lead to increased safety and perceptions of safety for DHCWs and their patients and promote willingness to provide and access oral health care services. Objective This study is designed to develop procedures that test the feasibility of enhanced COVID-19 triage and testing in dental offices. It will provide preliminary data to support a larger network-wide study grant application aimed at developing protocols to address safety concerns of patients and DHCWs in a peri–COVID-19 pandemic era. Methods The feasibility study is being conducted in 4 private dental practices, each of which has a dentist member of the National Dental Practice–Based Research Network. Participants include the DHCWs and patients of the dental practice. Study procedures include completion of COVID-19 triage, completion of COVID-19 testing (point-of-care [POC] or laboratory-based [LAB] SARS-CoV-2 viral, antigen, and antibody tests based on office designation), and administration of perception and attitude surveys for participating DCHWs and patients of the dental practice over a defined study period. The office designation and the participant’s role in the practice determines which testing protocol is executed within the office. There are 4 study groups following 4 distinct protocols: (1) POC DHCWs, (2) POC patients, (3) LAB DHCWs, and (4) LAB patients. Results Data collection began in December of 2021 and concluded in March 2022. Study results are expected to be published in fall 2022. Conclusions The results of this feasibility study will help identify the viability and functionality of COVID-19 triage and testing in dental practices and inform a larger network-wide study grant application that develops protocols that address safety concerns of patients and DHCWs in a COVID-19 environment.

This study monitored the SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels in the wastewater of a Canadian university campus for a year to provide actionable information to safely manage COVID-19 on campus. Wastewater samples were collected from the campus sewer and residence buildings to identify changes, peaks, and hotspots and search for associations with campus events, social gatherings, long weekends, and holidays. Furthermore, the impact of wastewater parameters (total solids, volatile solids, temperature, pH, turbidity, and UV absorbance) on SARS-CoV-2 detection was investigated, and the efficiency of ultrafiltration and centrifugation concentration methods were compared. RT-qPCR was used for detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Wastewater signals largely correlated positively with the clinically confirmed COVID-19 cases on campus. Long weekends and holidays were often followed by increased viral signals, and the implementation of lockdowns quickly decreased the case numbers. In spite of online teaching and restricted access to campus, the university represented a microcosm of the city and mirrored the same trends. Results indicated that the centrifugation concentration method was more sensitive for wastewater with high solids content and that the ultrafiltration concentration method was more sensitive for wastewater with low solids content. Wastewater characteristics collected from the buildings and the campus sewer were different. Statistical analysis was performed to manifest the observations.

doi:10.3233/JND-221668,Closing the Gap - Detection of 5q-Spinal Muscular Atrophy by Short-Read Next-Generation Sequencing and Unexpected Results in a Diagnostic Patient Cohort,"Background: The importance of early diagnosis of 5q-Spinal muscular atrophy (5q-SMA) has heightened as early intervention can significantly improve clinical outcomes. In 96% of cases, 5q-SMA is caused by a homozygous deletion of SMN1. Around 4 % of patients carry a SMN1 deletion and a single-nucleotide variant (SNV) on the other allele. Traditionally, diagnosis is based on multiplex ligation probe amplification (MLPA) to detect homozygous or heterozygous exon 7 deletions in SMN1. Due to high homologies within the SMN1/SMN2 locus, sequence analysis to identify SNVs of the SMN1 gene is unreliable by standard Sanger or short-read next-generation sequencing (srNGS) methods. Objective: The objective was to overcome the limitations in high-throughput srNGS with the aim of providing SMA patients with a fast and reliable diagnosis to enable their timely therapy. Methods: A bioinformatics workflow to detect homozygous SMN1 deletions and SMN1 SNVs on srNGS analysis was applied to diagnostic whole exome and panel testing for suggested neuromuscular disorders (1684 patients) and to fetal samples in prenatal diagnostics (260 patients). SNVs were detected by aligning sequencing reads from SMN1 and SMN2 to an SMN1 reference sequence. Homozygous SMN1 deletions were identified by filtering sequence reads for the ,, gene-determining variant“ (GDV). Results: 10 patients were diagnosed with 5q-SMA based on (i) SMN1 deletion and hemizygous SNV (2 patients), (ii) homozygous SMN1 deletion (6 patients), and (iii) compound heterozygous SNVs in SMN1 (2 patients). Conclusions: Applying our workflow in srNGS-based panel and whole exome sequencing (WES) is crucial in a clinical laboratory, as otherwise patients with an atypical clinical presentation initially not suspected to suffer from SMA remain undiagnosed.",Journal of Neuromuscular Diseases,2023,secondary,doi:10.3233/JND-221668,37424474,10578226,https://doi.org/doi:10.3233/JND-221668,

However, the exact mechanisms underlying its anti-inflammatory action are incompletely characterized. Here, we show that in KD, a pediatric acute vasculitis that affects the coronary arteries, IVIG induces a repertoire of natural Treg that recognize immunodominant peptides in the Fc heavy chain constant region. To address which antigen-presenting cell (APC) populations present Fc peptides to Treg, we studied the uptake of IgG by innate cells in subacute KD patients 2 weeks after IVIG and in children 1.6–14 years after KD. Healthy adults served as controls. IgG at high concentrations was internalized predominantly by two myeloid dendritic cell (DC) lineages, CD14+ cDC2 and ILT-4+ CD4+ tmDC mostly through Fcγ receptor (R) II and to a lesser extent FcγRIII. Following IgG internalization, these two DC lineages secreted IL-10 and presented processed Fc peptides to Treg. The validation of IVIG function in expanding Fc-specific Treg presented by CD14+ cDC2 and ILT-4+ CD4+ tmDC was addressed in a small cohort of patients with MIS-C. Taken together, these results suggest a novel immune regulatory function of IgG in activating tolerogenic innate cells and expanding Treg, which reveals an important anti-inflammatory mechanism of action of IVIG.",Clinical and Experimental Immunology,2022,secondary,doi:10.1093/cei/uxac046,35536993,9226148,https://doi.org/doi:10.1093/cei/uxac046,

Methods: Environmental samples were collected from a makeshift hospital. The extent of contamination was assessed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) for SARS-CoV-2 RNA from various samples. Results: There was a wide range of total collected samples contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 RNA, ranging from 8.47% to 100%. Results revealed that 70.00% of sewage from the bathroom and 48.19% of air samples were positive. The highest rate of contamination was found from the no-touch surfaces (73.07%) and the lowest from frequently touched surfaces (33.40%). The most contaminated objects were the top surfaces of patient cubic partitions (100%). The median Ct values among strongly positive samples were 33.38 (IQR, 31.69–35.07) and 33.24 (IQR, 31.33–34.34) for ORF1ab and N genes, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 relic RNA can be detected on indoor surfaces for up to 20 days. Conclusion: The findings show a higher prevalence and persistence in detecting the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the makeshift COVID-19 hospital setting.

Herein, we sequenced a Chinese Quartet, consisting of two monozygotic twin daughters and their biological parents, with multiple advanced sequencing platforms, including Illumina, BGI, PacBio, and Oxford Nanopore Technology. We phased the long reads of the monozygotic twin daughters into paternal and maternal haplotypes using the parent-child genetic map. For each haplotype, we utilized advanced long reads to generate haplotype-resolved assemblies (HRAs) with high accuracy, completeness, and continuity. Based on the ingenious quartet samples, novel computational methods, high-quality sequencing reads, and HRAs, we established a comprehensive variant benchmark, including 3,883,283 SNVs, 859,256 Indels, 9,678 large deletions, 15,324 large insertions, 40 inversions, and 31 complex structural variants shared between the monozygotic twin daughters. In particular, the preciously excluded regions, such as repeat regions and the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region, were systematically examined. Finally, we illustrated how the sequencing depth correlated with the de novo assembly and variant detection, from which we learned that 30 × HiFi is a balance between performance and cost. In summary, this study provides high-quality haplotype-resolved assemblies and a variant benchmark for two Chinese monozygotic twin samples. The benchmark expanded the regions of the previous report and adapted to the evolving sequencing technologies and computational methods.",bioRxiv,2022,secondary,doi:10.1101/2022.09.08.504083,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2022.09.08.504083,

doi:10.3389/fmicb.2022.889811,SARS-CoV-2 Whole-Genome Sequencing Using Oxford Nanopore Technology for Variant Monitoring in Wastewaters,"Since the beginning of the Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic, multiple Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mutations have been reported and led to the emergence of variants of concern (VOC) with increased transmissibility, virulence or immune escape. In parallel, the observation of viral fecal shedding led to the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in wastewater, providing information about the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infections within a population including symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Here, we aimed to adapt a sequencing technique initially designed for clinical samples to apply it to the challenging and mixed wastewater matrix, and hence identify the circulation of VOC at the community level. Composite raw sewage sampled over 24 h in two wastewater-treatment plants (WWTPs) from a city in western France were collected weekly and SARS-CoV-2 quantified by RT-PCR. Samples collected between October 2020 and May 2021 were submitted to whole-genome sequencing (WGS) using the primers and protocol published by the ARTIC Network and a MinION Mk1C sequencer (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, United Kingdom). The protocol was adapted to allow near-full genome coverage from sewage samples, starting from ∼5% to reach ∼90% at depth 30. This enabled us to detect multiple single-nucleotide variant (SNV) and assess the circulation of the SARS-CoV-2 VOC Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta. Retrospective analysis of sewage samples shed light on the emergence of the Alpha VOC with detection of first co-occurring signature mutations in mid-November 2020 to reach predominance of this variant in early February 2021. In parallel, a mutation-specific qRT-PCR assay confirmed the spread of the Alpha VOC but detected it later than WGS. Altogether, these data show that SARS-CoV-2 sequencing in sewage can be used for early detection of an emerging VOC in a population and confirm its ability to track shifts in variant predominance.",Frontiers in Microbiology,2022,secondary,doi:10.3389/fmicb.2022.889811,35756003,9218694,https://doi.org/doi:10.3389/fmicb.2022.889811,

doi:10.1101/2021.05.25.21257695,Spread of endemic SARS-CoV-2 lineages in Russia before April 2021,"In 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic is characterized by global spread of several lineages with evidence for increased transmissibility. Russia is among the countries with the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, making it a potential hotspot for emergence of novel variants. Here, we show that among the globally significant variants of concern, B.1.1.7 (501Y.V1), B.1.351 (501Y.V2) or P.1 (501Y.V3), none have been sampled in Russia before January 2021. Instead, since summer 2020, the epidemic in Russia has been characterized by the spread of two lineages that are rare elsewhere: B.1.1.317 and a sublineage of B.1.1 including B.1.1.397 (hereafter, B.1.1.397+). In February-March 2021, these lineages reached frequencies of 26.9% (95% C.I.: 23.1%-31.1%) and 32.8% (95% C.I.28.6%-37.2%) respectively in Russia. Their frequency has increased in different parts of Russia. Together with the fact that these lineages carry several spike mutations of interest, this suggests that B.1.1.317 and B.1.1.397+ may be more transmissible than the previously predominant B.1.1, although there is no direct data on change in transmissibility. Comparison of frequency dynamics of lineages carrying subsets of characteristic mutations of B.1.1.317 and B.1.1.397+ suggests that, if indeed some of these mutations affect transmissibility, the transmission advantage of B.1.1.317 may be conferred by the (S:D138Y+S:S477N+S:A845S) combination; while the advantage of B.1.1.397+ may be conferred by the S:M153T change. On top of these lineages, in January 2021, B.1.1.7 emerged in Russia, reaching the frequency of 17.4% (95% C.I.: 12.0%-24.4%) in March 2021. Additionally, we identify three novel distinct lineages, AT.1, and two lineages prospectively named B.1.1.v1 and B.1.1.v2, that have started to spread, together reaching the frequency of 11.8% (95% C.I.: 7.5%-18.1%) in March 2021. These lineages carry combinations of several notable mutations, including the S:E484K mutation of concern, deletions at a recurrent deletion region of the spike glycoprotein (S:{Delta}140-142, S:{Delta}144 or S:{Delta}136-144), and nsp6:{Delta}106-108 (also known as ORF1a:{Delta}3675-3677). Community-based PCR testing indicates that these variants have continued to spread in April 2021, with the frequency of B.1.1.7 reaching 21.7% (95% C.I.: 12.3%-35.6%), and the joint frequency of B.1.1.v1 and B.1.1.v2, 15.2% (95% C.I.: 7.6%-28.2%). The combinations of mutations observed in B.1.1.317, B.1.1.397+, AT.1, B.1.1.v1 and B.1.1.v2 together with frequency increase of these lineages make them candidate variants of interest.",PLoS ONE,2021,secondary,doi:10.1101/2021.05.25.21257695,35857745,9299347,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2021.05.25.21257695,

doi:10.1101/2022.02.28.482392,Deep Learning in Spatial Transcriptomics: Learning From the Next Next-Generation Sequencing,"Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies are rapidly becoming the extension of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq), holding the potential of profiling gene expression at a single-cell resolution while maintaining cellular compositions within a tissue. Having both expression profiles and tissue organization enables researchers to better understand cellular interactions and heterogeneity, providing insight into complex biological processes that would not be possible with traditional sequencing technologies. The data generated by ST technologies are inherently noisy, high-dimensional, sparse, and multi-modal (including histological images, count matrices, etc.), thus requiring specialized computational tools for accurate and robust analysis. However, many ST studies currently utilize traditional scRNAseq tools, which are inadequate for analyzing complex ST datasets. On the other hand, many of the existing ST-specific methods are built upon traditional statistical or machine learning frameworks, which have shown to be sub-optimal in many applications due to the scale, multi-modality, and limitations of spatially-resolved data (such as spatial resolution, sensitivity and gene coverage). Given these intricacies, researchers have developed deep learning (DL)-based models to alleviate ST-specific challenges. These methods include new state-of-the-art models in alignment, spatial reconstruction, and spatial clustering among others. However, deep-learning models for ST analysis are nascent and remain largely underexplored. In this review, we provide an overview of existing state-of-the-art tools for analyzing spatially-resolved transcriptomics, while delving deeper into the DL-based approaches.

In total, fourteen children with MIS-C (n=8) and KD (n=6) were included in the period of March-June 2020. Clinical and routine blood parameters, cardiac follow-up, SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies and CD4+ T-cell responses, and cytokine-profiles were determined in both groups.

Tissue-specific outcomes of infection are also evident in many infectious diseases, suggesting that the local microenvironment may instruct complex and diverse innate and adaptive cellular responses resulting in locally distinct molecular signatures. In turn, these molecular signatures may both drive and be responsive to local metabolic changes in immune as well as non-immune cells, ultimately shaping the outcome of infection. Given the spatial complexity of immune and inflammatory responses during infection, it is evident that understanding the spatial organization of transcripts, proteins, lipids, and metabolites is pivotal to delineating the underlying regulation of local immunity. Molecular imaging techniques like mass spectrometry imaging and spatially resolved, highly multiplexed immunohistochemistry and transcriptomics can define detailed metabolic signatures at the microenvironmental level. Moreover, a successful complementation of these two imaging techniques would allow multi-omics analyses of inflammatory microenvironments to facilitate understanding of disease pathogenesis and identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention.

Adenosine (A)-to-Inosine (I) RNA editing is a post-transcriptional modification, catalyzed by the ADAR family of enzymes, that can be considered part of the inherent cellular defense mechanism as it affects the innate immune response in a complex manner. It was previously reported that various viruses could interact with the host's ADAR enzymes, resulting in epigenetic changes both to the virus and the host. Here, we analyze RNA-seq of nasopharyngeal swab specimens as well as whole-blood samples of COVID-19 infected individuals and show a significant elevation in the global RNA editing activity in COVID-19 compared to healthy controls. We also detect specific coding sites that exhibit higher editing activity. We further show that the increment in editing activity during the disease is temporary and returns to baseline shortly after the symptomatic period. These significant epigenetic changes may contribute to the immune system response and affect adverse outcomes seen in post-viral cases.",NAR Genomics and Bioinformatics,2023,secondary,doi:10.1093/nargab/lqad092,37859800,10583280,https://doi.org/doi:10.1093/nargab/lqad092,

The most frequently observed risk factors were pediatric intensive care unit hospitalization (61.7%), central venous catheter (36.7%), age >12 years (36.7%), left ventricular ejection fraction <35% (28.3%), D-dimer >5 times the upper limit of normal values (71.9%), mechanical ventilation (23.3%), obesity (23.3%), and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (15%). TEs may concurrently affect multiple vessels, including both arterial and venous. Arterial thrombosis was more frequent, mainly affecting the cerebral and pulmonary vascular systems. Despite antithrombotic prophylaxis, 40% of MIS-C patients developed TEs. Over one-third of patients presented persistent focal neurological signs, and ten patients died, half of whom died because of TEs. TEs are severe and life-threatening complications of MIS-C.

Beginning in early 2021, we implemented a targeted approach to amplify and sequence the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-COV-2 to characterize viral lineages present in sewersheds. Over the course of 2021, we reproducibly detected multiple SARS-COV-2 RBD lineages that have never been observed in patient samples in 9 sewersheds located in 3 states in the USA. These cryptic lineages contained between 4 to 24 amino acid substitutions in the RBD and were observed intermittently in the sewersheds in which they were found for as long as 14 months. Many of the amino acid substitutions in these lineages occurred at residues also mutated in the Omicron variant of concern (VOC), often with the same substitutions. One of the sewersheds contained a lineage that appeared to be derived from the Alpha VOC, but the majority of the lineages appeared to be derived from pre-VOC SARS-COV-2 lineages. Specifically, several of the cryptic lineages from New York City appeared to be derived from a common ancestor that most likely diverged in early 2020. While the source of these cryptic lineages has not been resolved, it seems increasingly likely that they were derived from long-term patient infections or animal reservoirs.

We have recently showcased the possibility of predicting systemic concentrations of valproic acid (VPA), an anti-seizure medication by real-time breath analysis in two real clinical settings. This approach, however, comes with the limitation of the patients having to physically exhale into the mass spectrometer. This restricts the possibility of sampling from patients not capable or available to exhale into the mass spectrometer located on the hospital premises. In this work, we developed an alternative method to overcome this limitation by collecting the breath samples in customized bags and subsequently analyzing them by secondary electrospray ionization coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (SESI-HRMS). A total of n = 40 patients (mean ± SD, 11.5 ± 3.5 y.o.) diagnosed with epilepsy and taking VPA were included in this study. The patients underwent three measurements: (i) serum concentrations of total and free VPA, (ii) real-time breath analysis and (iii) off-line analysis of exhaled breath collected in bags. The agreement between the real-time and the off-line breath analysis methods was evaluated using Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient (CCC). CCC was computed for ten mass spectral predictors of VPA concentrations. Lin’s CCC was >0.6 for all VPA-associated features, except for two low-signal intensity isotopic peaks. Finally, free and total serum VPA concentrations were predicted by cross validating the off-line data set. Support vector machine algorithms provided the most accurate predictions with a root mean square error of cross validation of 29.0 ± 7.4 mg l−1 and 3.9 ± 1.4 mg l−1 for total and free VPA (mean ± SD), respectively. As a secondary analysis, we explored whether exhaled metabolites previously associated with side-effects and response to medication could be rendered by the off-line analysis method. We found that five features associated with side effects showed a CCC > 0.6, whereas none of the drug response-associated peaks reached this cut-off. We conclude that the clinically relevant free fraction of VPA can be predicted by this combination of off-line breath collection with rapid SESI-HRMS analysis. This opens new possibilities for breath based TDM in clinical settings.",Journal of Breath Research,2023,secondary,doi:10.1088/1752-7163/acf782,37678210,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1088/1752-7163/acf782,

With both multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) and HUS sharing complement dysregulation as one of the key factors, the aim of this case report is to highlight differences between these two conditions and also emphasize the importance of complement blockade as a treatment modality. Case report We describe a 21-month-old toddler who initially presented with fever and confirmed COVID-19. His condition quickly deteriorated and he developed oliguria, accompanied with diarrhea, vomiting and oral intake intolerance. HUS was suspected, supported with compelling laboratory findings, including decreased platelets count and C3 levels, elevated LDH, urea, serum creatinine and sC5b-9 and presence of schistocytes in peripheral blood, negative fecal Shiga toxin and normal ADAMTS13 metalloprotease activity. The patient was given C5 complement blocker Ravulizumab and started to display rapid improvement. Conclusion Although reports of HUS in the setting of COVID-19 continue to pour in, the questions of exact mechanism and similarities to MIS-C remain. Our case for the first time accentuates the use of complement blockade as a valuable treatment option in this scenario. We sincerely believe that reporting on HUS as a complication of COVID-19 in children will give rise to improved diagnosis and treatment, as well as better understanding of both of these intricating diseases.",Frontiers in Pediatrics,2023,secondary,doi:10.3389/fped.2023.1092860,36873657,9975343,https://doi.org/doi:10.3389/fped.2023.1092860,

The aims were to define an algorithmically interpreted novel cytokine/chemokine assay panel providing such an objective classification. This study was conducted on 4 groups of patients seen at multiple sites of Texas Childrens Hospital, Houston, TX who consented to provide blood samples to our COVID-19 Biorepository. Standard laboratory markers of inflammation and a novel cytokine/chemokine array were measured in blood samples of all patients. Group 1 consisted of 72 COVID-19, 66 MIS-C and 63 uninfected control patients seen between May 2020 and January 2021 and predominantly infected with pre-alpha variants. Group 2 consisted of 29 COVID-19 and 43 MIS-C patients seen between January-May 2021 infected predominantly with the alpha variant. Group 3 consisted of 30 COVID-19 and 32 MIS-C patients seen between August-October 2021 infected with alpha and/or delta variants. Group 4 consisted of 20 COVID-19 and 46 MIS-C patients seen between October 2021- January 2022 infected with delta and/or omicron variants. Group 1 was used to train a L1-regularized logistic regression model which was validated using 5-fold cross validation, and then separately validated against the remaining naive groups. The area under receiver operating curve (AUROC) and F1-score were used to quantify the performance of the algorithmically interpreted cytokine/chemokine assay panel. Standard laboratory markers predict MIS-C with a 5-fold cross-validated AUROC of 0.86 {+/-} 0.05 and an F1 score of 0.78{+/-}0.07, while the cytokine/chemokine panel predicted MIS-C with a 5-fold cross-validated AUROC of 0.95 {+/-} 0.02 and an F1 score of 0.91 {+/-} 0.04, with only sixteen of the forty-five cytokines/chemokines sufficient to achieve this performance. Tested on Group 2 the cytokine/chemokine panel yielded AUROC =0.98, F1=0.93, on Group 3 it yielded AUROC=0.89 , F1 = 0.89, and on Group 4 AUROC= 0.99, F1= 0.97. Adding standard laboratory markers to the cytokine/chemokine panel did not improve performance. A top-10 subset of these 16 cytokines achieved equivalent performance on the validation data sets.

RT-LAMP has also penetrated commercial markets, with emergency use authorizations for clinical diagnosis. Areas covered This review discusses the role of RT-LAMP within the context of other technologies like RT-qPCR and rapid antigen tests, progress in sample preparation strategies to enable simplified workflow for RT-LAMP directly from clinical specimens, new challenges with primer and assay design for the evolving pandemic, prominent detection modalities including colorimetric and CRISPR-mediated methods, and translational research and commercial development of RT-LAMP for clinical applications. Expert opinion RT-LAMP occupies a middle ground between RT-qPCR and rapid antigen tests. The simplicity approaches that of rapid antigen tests, making it suitable for point-of-care use, but the sensitivity nears that of RT-qPCR. RT-LAMP still lags RT-qPCR in fundamental understanding of the mechanism, and the interplay between sample preparation and assay performance. Industry is now beginning to address issues around scalability and usability, which could finally enable LAMP and RT-LAMP to find future widespread application as a diagnostic for other conditions, including other pathogens with pandemic potential.",Expert Review of Molecular Diagnostics,2023,secondary,doi:10.1080/14737159.2023.2169071,36695788,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1080/14737159.2023.2169071,

Evaluating the public health threat posed by a new variant is essential for appropriately adapting response efforts when community transmission is detected. However, this assessment requires that a true comparison can be made between the new variant and its predecessors because factors other than the virus genotype may influence spread and transmission. In this study, we develop a framework that integrates genomic surveillance data to estimate the relative effective reproduction number (Rt) of co-circulating lineages. We use Connecticut, a state in the northeastern United States in which the SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.526 co-circulated in early 2021, as a case study for implementing this framework. We find that the Rt of B.1.1.7 was 6-10% larger than that of B.1.526 in Connecticut in the midst of a COVID-19 vaccination campaign. To assess the generalizability of this framework, we apply it to genomic surveillance data from New York City and observe the same trend. Finally, we use discrete phylogeography to demonstrate that while both variants were introduced into Connecticut at comparable frequencies, clades that resulted from introductions of B.1.1.7 were larger than those resulting from B.1.526 introductions. Our framework, which uses open-source methods requiring minimal computational resources, may be used to monitor near real-time variant dynamics in a myriad of settings.",medRxiv,2021,secondary,doi:10.1101/2021.07.01.21259859,34230938,8259915,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2021.07.01.21259859,

Despite several attempts to estimate the model’s parameters, almost all existing estimation strategies are non-robust against outliers. Outliers in the quadratic and interaction effects may deteriorate the model structure more severely than their effects in the main effect. We propose a robust estimation strategy based on the robust functional principal component decomposition of the function-valued variables and [Formula: see text]-estimator. The performance of the proposed method relies on the truncation parameters in the robust functional principal component decomposition of the function-valued variables. A robust Bayesian information criterion is used to determine the optimum truncation constants. A forward stepwise variable selection procedure is employed to determine relevant main, quadratic, and interaction effects to address a possible model misspecification. The finite-sample performance of the proposed method is investigated via a series of Monte-Carlo experiments.

In adults, the Sepsis-3 Definition Taskforce queried databases from high-income countries to develop and validate the criteria. The merit of this definition has been widely acknowledged; however, important considerations about less-resourced and more diverse settings pose challenges to its use globally. To improve applicability and relevance globally, the Pediatric Sepsis Definition Taskforce sought to develop a conceptual framework and rationale of the critical aspects and context-specific factors that must be considered for the optimal operationalization of future pediatric sepsis definitions. It is important to address challenges in developing a set of pediatric sepsis criteria which capture manifestations of illnesses with vastly different etiologies and underlying mechanisms. Ideal criteria need to be unambiguous, and capable of adapting to the different contexts in which children with suspected infections are present around the globe. Additionally, criteria need to facilitate early recognition and timely escalation of treatment to prevent progression and limit life-threatening organ dysfunction. To address these challenges, locally adaptable solutions are required, which permit individualized care based on available resources and the pretest probability of sepsis. This should facilitate affordable diagnostics which support risk stratification and prediction of likely treatment responses, and solutions for locally relevant outcome measures. For this purpose, global collaborative databases need to be established, using minimum variable datasets from routinely collected data.

Despite the extensively studied clinical manifestation of acute condition, the short- and long-term effects of MIS-c on children's health are unknown. Methods This was a prospective longitudinal cohort study. Children aged <18 years who met the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) diagnostic criteria and who were admitted to the Children's Clinical University Hospital of Latvia (CCUH) between July 1, 2020, and April 15, 2022, were enrolled in the study. An outpatient follow-up program was initiated in July 2020. All children were evaluated at 2 weeks, 2 months (1–3 months), and 6 months (5–7 months) after discharge. The face-to-face interviews comprised four domains as follows: symptom assessment, physical examination, laboratory testing, and cardiological investigation [including electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiography (echo)]. Results Overall, 21 patients with MIS-c were enrolled. The median age of the study group was 6 years. At the 2-week follow-up, almost half of the patients (N = 10, 47.6%) reported exercise intolerance with provoked tiredness. Laboratory tests showed a considerable increase in blood cell count, with a near doubling of leukocyte and neutrophil counts and a tripling of thrombocyte levels. However, a decline in the levels of inflammatory and organ-specific markers was observed. Cardiological investigation showed significant improvement with gradual resolution of the acute-phase pathological findings. Within 2 months, improvement in exercise capacity was observed with 5-fold and 2-fold reductions in physical intolerance (N = 2, 9.5%) and physical activity-induced fatigue (N = 5, 23.8%), respectively. Normalization of all blood cell lines was observed, and cardiological investigation showed no persistent changes. At the 6-month visit, further improvement in the children's exercise capacity was observed, and both laboratory and cardiological investigation showed no pathological changes. Conclusions Most persistent symptoms were reported within the first 2 weeks after the acute phase, with decreased physical activity tolerance and activity-induced fatigue as the main features. A positive trend was observed at each follow-up visit as the spectrum of the children's complaints decreased. Furthermore, rapid normalization of laboratory markers and cardiac abnormalities was observed.",Frontiers in Pediatrics,2023,secondary,doi:10.3389/fped.2023.1223266,37650048,10465300,https://doi.org/doi:10.3389/fped.2023.1223266,
doi:10.3390/ani12151912,Antimicrobial Resistance in Bacteria Isolated from Exotic Pets: The Situation in the Iberian Peninsula,"Simple Summary Antimicrobial resistance in exotic pets has not been widely studied. The close contact of this type of animal with the human population increases the risk of untreatable bacterial infections, which represent a veterinary and human public health challenge. We analyze the database of microbiological diagnoses and the bacterial susceptibility to antimicrobials in exotic pets from the Iberian Peninsula. We found that the most prevalent bacteria in birds and mammals were Staphylococcus spp., while in reptiles, they were the Pseudomonas spp. In addition, Pseudomonas showed the highest levels of resistance among the three animal groups, and on the other hand, the multidrug resistance level was significant in Enterobacterales. Most of the bacteria we found have zoonotic importance. The prevalent bacteria are resistant to antimicrobials that have been described as critical for human use, implying that the threat of antimicrobial resistance extends not only to domestic and companion animals but also to humans due to the potential transmission of resistant genes. Once seen from the lens of the One-Health paradigm, these findings are concerning, as they highlight the risk of spreading antibiotic-resistant genes between different individuals and their environments. In order to prevent antibiotic resistance, we encourage the development of joint work between animal and human health specialists. Abstract Literature related to antimicrobial resistant (AMR) bacteria in exotic pets is minimal, being essential to report objective data on this topic, which represents a therapeutic challenge for veterinary medicine and public health. Between 2016 and 2020, laboratory records of 3156 exotic pet specimens’ microbiological diagnoses and antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) results were examined. The samples were classified into three animal classes: birds (n = 412), mammalia (n = 2399), and reptilian (n = 345). The most prevalent bacteria in birds and mammals were Staphylococcus spp. (15% and 16%), while in reptiles they were Pseudomonas spp. (23%). Pseudomonas was the genus with the highest levels of AMR in all animal groups, followed by Enterococcus spp. By contrast, Gram-positive cocci and Pasteurella spp. were the most sensitive bacteria. Moreover, in reptiles, Stenotrophomonas spp., Morganella spp., and Acinetobacter spp. presented high levels of AMR. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria were isolates from reptiles (21%), birds (17%), and mammals (15%). The Enterobacterales had the highest MDR levels: S. marcescens (94.4%), C. freundii (50%), M. morganii (47.4%), K. pneumoniae (46.6%), E. cloacae (44%), and E. coli (38.3%). The prevalence of MDR P. aeruginosa strains was 8%, detecting one isolate with an XDR profile. Regarding antimicrobial use, many antibiotics described as critically important for human use had significant AMR prevalence in bacteria isolated from exotic pets. Under the One-Health approach, these results are alarming and of public health concern since potential transmission of AMR bacteria and genes can occur from exotic pets to their owners in both senses. For this reason, the collaboration between veterinarians and public health professionals is crucial.",Animals : an Open Access Journal from MDPI,2022,secondary,doi:10.3390/ani12151912,35953901,9367532,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/ani12151912,

However, sampling at wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) cannot identify transmission hotspots within a city. Here, we sought to understand the diurnal variations (24 h) in SARS-CoV-2 RNA titers at the neighborhood level, using pump stations that serve vulnerable communities (e.g., essential workers, more diverse communities). Hourly composite samples were collected from wastewater pump stations located in (i) a residential area and (ii) a shopping district. In the residential area, SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration (N1, N2, and E assays) varied by up to 42-fold within a 24 h period. The highest viral load was observed between 5 and 7 am, when viral RNA was not diluted by stormwater. Normalizing peak concentrations during this time window with nutrient concentrations (N and P) enabled correcting for rainfall to connect sewage to clinical cases reported in the sewershed. Data from the shopping district pump station were inconsistent, probably due to the fluctuation of customers shopping at the mall. This work indicates pump stations serving the residential area offer a narrow time period of high signal intensity that could improve the sensitivity of WBE, and tracer compounds (N, P concentration) can be used to normalize SARS-CoV-2 signals during rainfall.",ACS Es&t Water,2022,secondary,doi:10.1021/acsestwater.2c00016,,9261832,https://doi.org/doi:10.1021/acsestwater.2c00016,

IBD patients can be considered subjects with an aberrant immune response that makes them at increased risk of infections, particularly those due to opportunistic pathogens. In many cases this risk is significantly increased by the therapy they receive. Aim of this narrative review is to describe the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccines in patients with IBD. Available data indicate that patients with IBD do not have an increased susceptibility to infection with SARS-CoV-2 and that, if infected, in the majority of the cases they must not modify the therapy in place because this does not negatively affect the COVID-19 course. Only corticosteroids should be reduced or suspended due to the risk of causing severe forms. Furthermore, COVID-19 seems to modify the course of IBD mainly due to the impact on intestinal disease of the psychological factors deriving from the measures implemented to deal with the pandemic. The data relating to the immune response induced by SARS-CoV-2 or by COVID-19 vaccines can be considered much less definitive. It seems certain that the immune response to disease and vaccines is not substantially different from that seen in healthy subjects, with the exception of patients treated with anti-tumor necrosis factor alone or in combination with other immunosuppressants who showed a reduced immune response. How much, however, this problem reduces induced protection is not known.

Lately, smart sensing has awoken the world by the advent of smart face masks (SFMs) in the global fight against the deadly Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. In turn, a number of research studies on innovative SFM architectures and designs are emerging. However, there is currently no study that has systematically been conducted to identify and comparatively analyze the emerging architectures and designs of SFMs, their contributions, socio-technological implications, and current challenges. In this article, we investigate the emerging SFMs in response to Covid-19 pandemic and provide a concise review of their key features and characteristics, design, smart technologies, and architectures. We also highlight and discuss the socio-technological opportunities posed by the use of SFMs and finally present directions for future research. Our findings reveal four key features that can be used to evaluate SFMs to include reusability, self-power generation ability, energy awareness and aerosol filtration efficiency. We discover that SFM has potential for effective use in human tracking, contact tracing, disease detection and diagnosis or in monitoring asymptotic populations in future pandemics. Some SFMs have also been carefully designed to provide comfort and safety when used by patients with other respiratory diseases or comorbidities. However, some identified challenges include standards and quality control, ethical, security and privacy concerns.",IEEE Sensors Journal,2023,secondary,doi:10.1109/JSEN.2022.3225067,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1109/JSEN.2022.3225067,
doi:10.1111/mec.16456,Community Composition of Bacteria Isolated from Swiss Banknotes Varies Depending on Collection Environment,"Humans interact constantly with surfaces and associated microbial communities in the environment. The factors shaping the composition of these communities are poorly understood: some proposed explanations emphasize the influence of local habitat conditions (niche-based explanations), while others point to geographic structure and the distance among sampled locations (dispersal-based explanations). However, the relative roles of these different drivers for microbial community assembly on human-associated surfaces are not clear. Here, we used a combination of sampling, sequencing (16S rRNA) and culturing to show that the composition of banknote-associated bacterial communities varies depending on the local collection environment. Using banknotes collected from various locations and types of shops across Switzerland, we found taxonomic diversity dominated by families such as Pseudomonadaceae and Staphylococcaceae, but with banknote samples from particular types of shops (especially butcher shops) having distinct community structure. By contrast, we found no evidence of geographic structure: similarity of community composition did not decrease with increasing distance among sampled locations. These results show that microbial communities associated with banknotes, one of the most commonly encountered and exchanged human-associated surfaces, can reflect the local environmental conditions (in this case, the type of shop), and the signal for this type of variation was stronger than that for geographic structure among the locations sampled here.",bioRxiv,2021,secondary,doi:10.1111/mec.16456,35377495,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1111/mec.16456,

As a result, it can be leveraged for monitoring multiple dimensions of public health across locales and time. Here, we integrate targeted and bulk RNA sequencing (n=1,419 samples) to track the viral, bacterial, and functional content over geospatially distinct areas within Miami Dade County from 2020-2022. First, we used targeted amplicon sequencing (n=966) to track diverse SARS-CoV-2 variants across space and time, and we found a tight correspondence with clinical caseloads from University students (N = 1,503) and Miami-Dade County hospital patients (N = 3,939 patients), as well as an 8-day earlier detection of the Delta variant in wastewater vs. in patients. Additionally, in 453 metatranscriptomic samples, we demonstrate that different wastewater sampling locations have clinically and public-health-relevant microbiota that vary as a function of the size of the human population they represent. Through assembly, alignment-based, and phylogenetic approaches, we also detect multiple clinically important viruses (e.g., norovirus) and describe geospatial and temporal variation in microbial functional genes that indicate the presence of pollutants. Moreover, we found distinct profiles of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes and virulence factors across campus buildings, dorms, and hospitals, with hospital wastewater containing a significant increase in AMR abundance.

doi:10.1128/jvi.00597-23,"A low-background, fluorescent assay to evaluate inhibitors of diverse viral proteases","ABSTRACT Multiple coronaviruses (CoVs) can cause respiratory diseases in humans. While prophylactic vaccines designed to prevent infection are available for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), incomplete vaccine efficacy, vaccine hesitancy, and the threat of other pathogenic CoVs for which vaccines do not exist have highlighted the need for effective antiviral therapies. While antiviral compounds targeting the viral polymerase and protease are already in clinical use, their sensitivity to potential resistance mutations as well as their breadth against the full range of human and preemergent CoVs remain incompletely defined. To begin to fill that gap in knowledge, we report here the development of an improved, noninfectious, cell-based fluorescent assay with high sensitivity and low background that reports on the activity of viral proteases, which are key drug targets. We demonstrate that the assay is compatible with not only the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protein but also orthologues from a range of human and nonhuman CoVs as well as clinically reported SARS-CoV-2 drug-resistant Mpro variants. We then use this assay to define the breadth of activity of two clinically used protease inhibitors, nirmatrelvir and ensitrelvir. Continued use of this assay will help define the strengths and limitations of current therapies and may also facilitate the development of next-generation protease inhibitors that are broadly active against both currently circulating and preemergent CoVs. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses (CoVs) are important human pathogens with the ability to cause global pandemics. Working in concert with vaccines, antivirals specifically limit viral disease in people who are actively infected. Antiviral compounds that target CoV proteases are already in clinical use; their efficacy against variant proteases and preemergent zoonotic CoVs, however, remains incompletely defined. Here, we report an improved, noninfectious, and highly sensitive fluorescent method of defining the sensitivity of CoV proteases to small molecule inhibitors. We use this approach to assay the activity of current antiviral therapies against clinically reported SARS-CoV-2 protease mutants and a panel of highly diverse CoV proteases. Additionally, we show this system is adaptable to other structurally nonrelated viral proteases. In the future, this assay can be used to not only better define the strengths and limitations of current therapies but also help develop new, broadly acting inhibitors that more broadly target viral families.

In the US, specifically, rapid and widespread testing was quickly prioritized to lower restrictions sooner. Essentially, only two types of COVID-19 diagnostic tests were publicly employed during the peak pandemic: the rapid antigen test and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, neither test ideally suited the situation, as rapid antigen tests are far too inaccurate, and RT-PCR tests require skilled personnel and sophisticated equipment, leading to long wait times. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is another exceptionally accurate nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) that offers far quicker time to results. However, RT-LAMP COVID-19 tests have not been embraced as extensively as rapid antigen tests or RT-PCR. This review will investigate the performance of current RT-LAMP-based COVID-19 tests and summarize the reasons behind the hesitancy to embrace RT-LAMP instead of RT-PCR. We will also look at other LAMP platforms to explore possible improvements in the accuracy and portability of LAMP, which could be applied to COVID-19 diagnostics and future public-health outbreaks.",Biosensors,2022,secondary,doi:10.3390/bios12070492,35884295,9312731,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/bios12070492,

doi:10.3390/v15010070,On the Evolutionary Trajectory of SARS-CoV-2: Host Immunity as a Driver of Adaptation in RNA Viruses,"Host immunity can exert a complex array of selective pressures on a pathogen, which can drive highly mutable RNA viruses towards viral escape. The plasticity of a virus depends on its rate of mutation, as well as the balance of fitness cost and benefit of mutations, including viral adaptations to the host’s immune response. Since its emergence, SARS-CoV-2 has diversified into genetically distinct variants, which are characterised often by clusters of mutations that bolster its capacity to escape human innate and adaptive immunity. Such viral escape is well documented in the context of other pandemic RNA viruses such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and influenza virus. This review describes the selection pressures the host’s antiviral immunity exerts on SARS-CoV-2 and other RNA viruses, resulting in divergence of viral strains into more adapted forms. As RNA viruses obscure themselves from host immunity, they uncover weak points in their own armoury that can inform more comprehensive, long-lasting, and potentially cross-protective vaccine coverage.",Viruses,2022,secondary,doi:10.3390/v15010070,36680110,9866609,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/v15010070,

Hospitalization may be required, but the management can vary substantially depending on specific clinical characteristics. Models predicting admission and hospitalization length of stay (LoS) are lacking. The purpose of this study was to design an effective, exploratory model using machine learning (ML) technology to predict LoS for patients presenting with syncope. Methods: This was a retrospective analysis using over 4 million patients from the National Emergency Department Sample (NEDS) database presenting to the ED with syncope between 2016–2019. A multilayer perceptron neural network with one hidden layer was trained and validated on this data set. Results: Receiver Operator Characteristics (ROC) were determined for each of the five ANN models with varying cutoffs for LoS. A fair area under the curve (AUC of 0.78) to good (AUC of 0.88) prediction performance was achieved based on sequential analysis at different cutoff points, starting from the same day discharge and ending at the longest analyzed cutoff LoS ≤7 days versus >7 days, accordingly. The ML algorithm showed significant sensitivity and specificity in predicting short (≤48 h) versus long (>48 h) LoS, with an AUC of 0.81. Conclusions: Using variables available to triaging ED clinicians, ML shows promise in predicting hospital LoS with fair to good performance for patients presenting with syncope.",Journal of Personalized Medicine,2022,secondary,doi:10.3390/jpm13010007,36675668,9864075,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/jpm13010007,

As the human adenovirus (HAdV) is linked to clinical episodes of gastroenteritis in children, the present investigation aimed to detect HAdVs in three wastewater treatment plants in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia (King Saud University (KSU-WWTP), Manfoha (MN-WWTP), and Embassy Quarter (EMB-WWTP)). The impact of seasonal variability and meteorological factors on the prevalence of HAdVs was also investigated. The HAdV hexon sequences of the isolated human adenoviruses were phylogenetically analyzed and revealed that the F species of HAdV, especially serotype 41, dominated. The highest prevalence of HAdV was detected in KSU-WWTP (83.3%), followed by MN-WWTP (75%), and EMB-WWTP (66.6%). Seasonal distribution insignificantly influenced the HAdV prevalence among sampling areas (p > 0.05). The highest prevalence of HAdVs (100%) was detected in late Summer and Autumn at temperatures (high: 34–43 °C, low: 18–32 °C) and moderate prevalence of 66.67% in Winter (particularly, in January and February) at lower temperature ranges (high: 26 °C, low: 10 °C–12 °C). The large variation of HAdV prevalence detected at different humidity ranges emphasized the significant impact of relative humidity on HAdV incidence in raw water of WWTPs (p = 0.009, R2 = 0.419). In contrast, wind speed was detected to have insignificant influence on HAdV prevalence among different WWTPs (p > 0.05, R2 = 0.03). The study provides important data for the incidence of HAdVs in wastewater treatments plants in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, which enabled the successful management of health hazards of viral diseases transmitted via fecal-oral route. In addition, the non-significant influence of seasonal variability on HAdV prevalence highlights the potentiality of utilizing HAdVs as a potential fecal indicator of wastewater contamination.",Water,2023,secondary,doi:10.3390/w15071367,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/w15071367,

However, incompletely vaccinated children may develop Omicron‐related complications such as those affecting the central nervous system. To characterize the spectrum of clinical manifestations of neuro‐COVID and to identify potential biomarkers associated with clinical outcomes, we recruited 15 children hospitalized for Omicron‐related neurological manifestations in three hospitals in Hong Kong (9 boys and 6 girls aged 1–13 years). All were unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated. Fourteen (93.3%) were admitted for convulsion, including benign febrile seizure (n = 7), complex febrile seizure (n = 2), seizure with fever (n = 3), and recurrent breakthrough seizure (n = 2), and the remaining nonconvulsive patient developed encephalopathic state with impaired consciousness.

doi:10.1542/peds.2022-058037,Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are chronic, immune-mediated disorders that include Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. A pediatric onset of disease occurs in about 10% of all cases. Clinical presentation of IBD with rectal bleeding or perianal disease warrants direct referral for endoscopic evaluation. In the absence of red-flag symptoms, a combination of patient history and blood and fecal biomarkers can help to distinguish suspected IBD from other causes of abdominal pain or diarrhea. The therapeutic management of pediatric IBD has evolved by taking into account predictors of poor outcome, which justifies the upfront use of anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy for patients at high risk for complicated disease. In treating patients with IBD, biochemical or endoscopic remission, rather than clinical remission, is the therapeutic goal because intestinal inflammation often persists despite resolution of abdominal symptoms. Pediatric IBD comes with unique additional challenges, such as growth impairment, pubertal delay, the psychology of adolescence, and development of body image. Even after remission has been achieved, many patients with IBD continue to experience nonspecific symptoms like abdominal pain and fatigue. Transfer to adult care is a well-recognized risk for disease relapse, which highlights patient vulnerability and the need for a transition program that is continued by the adult-oriented IBD team. The general pediatrician is an invaluable link in integrating these challenges in the clinical care of patients with IBD and optimizing their outcomes.

A 10-year-old boy presented with blunt trauma in a shock-like status, and a head injury was suspected. Since he was febrile two days before the trauma, another pathology was assumed. Imaging and laboratory evaluations were performed, and after excluding gross neurosurgical etiology, he was initially treated as a toxic shock syndrome. Meanwhile, he was deteriorating with continuous fever, impaired consciousness, and seizure on the following day. Although not considered initially, close monitoring with a multidisciplinary approach and serial investigations revealed that the child met the criteria of MIS-C. SARS-CoV-2 IgG was shown to be high, while the RT-PCR of COVID-19 was negative. Once he received immunoglobulin and methylprednisolone, he improved dramatically.

doi:10.1039/d2lc00554a,Promise and perils of paper-based point-of-care nucleic acid detection for endemic and pandemic pathogens.,"From HIV and influenza to emerging pathogens like COVID-19, each new infectious disease outbreak has highlighted the need for massively-scalable testing that can be performed outside centralized laboratory settings at the point-of-care (POC) in order to prevent, track, and monitor endemic and pandemic threats. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are highly sensitive and can be developed and scaled within weeks while protein-based rapid tests require months for production. Combining NAATs with paper-based detection platforms are promising due to the manufacturability, scalability, and simplicity of each of these components. Typically, paper-based NAATs consist of three sequential steps: sample collection and preparation, amplification of DNA or RNA from pathogens of interest, and detection. However, these exist within a larger ecosystem of sample collection and interpretation workflow, usability, and manufacturability which can be vastly perturbed during a pandemic emergence. This review aims to explore the challenges of paper-based NAATs covering sample-to-answer procedures along with three main types of clinical samples; blood, urine, and saliva, as well as broader operational, scale up, and regulatory aspects of device development and implementation. To fill the technological gaps in paper-based NAATs, a sample-in-result-out system that incorporates the integrated sample collection, sample preparation, and integrated internal amplification control while also balancing needs of users and manufacturability upfront in the early design process is required.",Lab on a chip,2023,secondary,doi:10.1039/d2lc00554a,36688463,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1039/d2lc00554a,

In this review, we address the different approaches to the steps needed for this surveillance: sampling wastewaters (WWs), concentrating the virus from the samples and quantifying them by qPCR, focusing on the main limitations of the methodologies used. Factors that can influence SARS‐CoV‐2 monitoring in WWs include: (i) physical parameters as temperature that can hamper the detection in warm seasons and tropical regions, (ii) sampling methodologies and timetables, being composite samples and Moore swabs the less variable and more sensitive approaches, (iii) virus concentration methodologies that need to be feasible and practicable in simpler laboratories and (iv) detection methodologies that should tend to use faster and cost‐effective procedures. The efficiency of WW treatments and the use of WWs for SARS‐CoV‐2 variants detection are also addressed. Furthermore, we discuss the need for the development of common standardized protocols, although these must be versatile enough to comprise variations among target communities.

In this study, we sampled a Mediterranean park and were able to isolate bacteria that have the ability to inhibit the growth of control microorganisms. Out of the 560 bacteria we tested, many displayed antibacterial activity, particularly against Salmonella sp. and K. pneumoniae. These results suggest that the microorganisms in the park are in close proximity to the human population. Additionally, the isolated bacteria demonstrated diverse enzymatic activities, possibly as a response to the environmental substances available to them, which could aid in the degradation of different compounds of interest. The study of the spatial distribution of soil parameters and the inhibition against relative-safe pathogens in an urban park in València (Spain) demonstrated a higher proportion of isolates in certain areas.

The purpose of this study is to analyze the published articles of IBD in the past decade via machine learning and text analysis and get a more comprehensive understanding of the research trends and changes in IBD in the past 10 years. Method In November 2021, we downloaded the published articles related to IBD in PubMed for the past 10 years (2012–2021). We utilized Python to extract the title, publication date, MeSH terms, and abstract from the metadata of each publication for bibliometric assessment. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) was used to the abstracts to identify publications' research topics with greater specificity. Result We finally identified and analyzed 34,458 publications in total. We found that publications in the last 10 years were mainly focused on treatment and mechanism. Among them, publications on biological agents and Gastrointestinal Microbiome have a significant advantage in terms of volume and rate of publications. In addition, publications related to IBD and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have increased sharply since the outbreak of the worldwide pandemic caused by novel β-coronavirus in 2019. However, researchers seem to pay less attention to the nutritional and psychological status of patients with IBD. Conclusion IBD is still a worldwide disease of concern with the publication of IBD-related research has expanded continuously over the past decade. More research related nutritional and psychological status of patients with IBD is needed in the future. Besides, it is worth noting that the management of chronic diseases such as IBD required additional attention during an infectious disease epidemic.",Frontiers in Medicine,2022,secondary,doi:10.3389/fmed.2022.880553,35665364,9160461,https://doi.org/doi:10.3389/fmed.2022.880553,
doi:10.3389/fpls.2023.1056603,"Translating virome analyses to support biosecurity, on-farm management, and crop breeding","Virome analysis via high-throughput sequencing (HTS) allows rapid and massive virus identification and diagnoses, expanding our focus from individual samples to the ecological distribution of viruses in agroecological landscapes. Decreases in sequencing costs combined with technological advances, such as automation and robotics, allow for efficient processing and analysis of numerous samples in plant disease clinics, tissue culture laboratories, and breeding programs. There are many opportunities for translating virome analysis to support plant health. For example, virome analysis can be employed in the development of biosecurity strategies and policies, including the implementation of virome risk assessments to support regulation and reduce the movement of infected plant material. A challenge is to identify which new viruses discovered through HTS require regulation and which can be allowed to move in germplasm and trade. On-farm management strategies can incorporate information from high-throughput surveillance, monitoring for new and known viruses across scales, to rapidly identify important agricultural viruses and understand their abundance and spread. Virome indexing programs can be used to generate clean germplasm and seed, crucial for the maintenance of seed system production and health, particularly in vegetatively propagated crops such as roots, tubers, and bananas. Virome analysis in breeding programs can provide insight into virus expression levels by generating relative abundance data, aiding in breeding cultivars resistant, or at least tolerant, to viruses. The integration of network analysis and machine learning techniques can facilitate designing and implementing management strategies, using novel forms of information to provide a scalable, replicable, and practical approach to developing management strategies for viromes. In the long run, these management strategies will be designed by generating sequence databases and building on the foundation of pre-existing knowledge about virus taxonomy, distribution, and host range. In conclusion, virome analysis will support the early adoption and implementation of integrated control strategies, impacting global markets, reducing the risk of introducing novel viruses, and limiting virus spread. The effective translation of virome analysis depends on capacity building to make benefits available globally.",Frontiers in Plant Science,2023,secondary,doi:10.3389/fpls.2023.1056603,36998684,10043385,https://doi.org/doi:10.3389/fpls.2023.1056603,

Three commercial miRNA extraction kits (mirVana, Nucleospin and miRNeasy) and three saliva collectors (50 mL tubes, Salimetrics and Oragene) were tested. Several features, including RNA quality and technical parameters, were evaluated. The expression of five synthetic spike-in controls and seven saliva-miRNAs was analyzed independently and grouped by the collectors and the extraction kits. The combination of Oragene and miRNeasy assured the most sensitive detection of all seven saliva miRNAs.

doi:10.3390/v16010040,Use of Capsid Integrity-qPCR for Detecting Viral Capsid Integrity in Wastewater,"Quantifying viruses in wastewater via RT-qPCR provides total genomic data but does not indicate the virus capsid integrity or the potential risk for human infection. Assessing virus capsid integrity in sewage is important for wastewater-based surveillance, since discharged effluent may pose a public health hazard. While integrity assays using cell cultures can provide this information, they require specialised laboratories and expertise. One solution to overcome this limitation is the use of photo-reactive monoazide dyes (e.g., propidium monoazide [PMAxx]) in a capsid integrity-RT-qPCR assay (ci-RT-qPCR). In this study, we tested the efficiency of PMAxx dye at 50 μM and 100 μM concentrations on live and heat-inactivated model viruses commonly detected in wastewater, including adenovirus (AdV), hepatitis A (HAV), influenza A virus (IAV), and norovirus GI (NoV GI). The 100 μM PMAxx dye concentration effectively differentiated live from heat-inactivated viruses for all targets in buffer solution. This method was then applied to wastewater samples (n = 19) for the detection of encapsulated AdV, enterovirus (EV), HAV, IAV, influenza B virus (IBV), NoV GI, NoV GII, and SARS-CoV-2. Samples were negative for AdV, HAV, IAV, and IBV but positive for EV, NoV GI, NoV GII, and SARS-CoV-2. In the PMAxx-treated samples, EV, NoV GI, and NoV GII showed −0.52–1.15, 0.9–1.51, and 0.31–1.69 log reductions in capsid integrity, indicating a high degree of potentially infectious virus in wastewater. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 was only detected using RT-qPCR but not after PMAxx treatment, indicating the absence of encapsulated and potentially infectious virus. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the utility of PMAxx dyes to evaluate capsid integrity across a diverse range of viruses commonly monitored in wastewater.",Viruses,2023,secondary,doi:10.3390/v16010040,38257740,10819219,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/v16010040,

To better understand the mechanism underlying long COVID biology, we compared the short- and long-term systemic responses in the golden hamster after either SARS-CoV-2 or influenza A virus (IAV) infection. Results demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 exceeded IAV in its capacity to cause permanent injury to the lung and kidney and uniquely affected the olfactory bulb (OB) and olfactory epithelium (OE). Despite a lack of detectable infectious virus, the OB and OE demonstrated myeloid and T cell activation, proinflammatory cytokine production, and an interferon response that correlated with behavioral changes extending a month after viral clearance. These sustained transcriptional changes could also be corroborated from tissue isolated from individuals who recovered from COVID-19. These data highlight a molecular mechanism for persistent COVID-19 symptomology and provide a small animal model to explore future therapeutics. Description SARS-CoV-2 infection results in sustained inflammation in the nervous system and is a driver of long COVID. Characterizing long COVID As millions of people have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and have subsequently recovered, a subset of these individuals has continued to experience chronic pathologies collectively called “long COVID.” Here, Frere et al. characterized the short- and long-term changes to multiple organs in hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2; influenza A virus was used as a comparator respiratory pathogen. The authors observed sustained changes in the lungs, kidney, olfactory bulb, and olfactory epithelium that were specific to hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2.

Rapid and accurate diagnostic tests are imperative for identifying and managing infected individuals, contact tracing, epidemiologic characterization, and public health decision making. Laboratory testing may be performed based on symptomatic presentation or for screening of asymptomatic people. Confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection is typically by nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT), which requires specialized equipment and training and may be particularly challenging in resource-limited settings. NAAT may give false-negative results due to timing of sample collection relative to infection, improper sampling of respiratory specimens, inadequate preservation of samples, and technical limitations; false-positives may occur due to technical errors, particularly contamination during the manual real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) process. Thus, clinical presentation, contact history and contemporary phyloepidemiology must be considered when interpreting results. Several sample-to-answer platforms, including high-throughput systems and Point of Care (PoC) assays, have been developed to increase testing capacity and decrease technical errors. Alternatives to RT-PCR assay, such as other RNA detection methods and antigen tests may be appropriate for certain situations, such as resource-limited settings. While sequencing is important to monitor on-going evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, antibody assays are useful for epidemiologic purposes. The ever-expanding assortment of tests, with varying clinical utility, performance requirements, and limitations, merits comparative evaluation.

We are not only interested in drinking water, but also the water used in bathrooms, gardens, and laundry of each household. We mention “water quality” because all of these kinds of water are enough to give us a direct stimulus such as odors and greens. When we use tap water in each household, the most direct irritation is the “smell”. In this case, we know that chlorine comes to mind first, and that chlorine is very useful in disinfection. Then, why are we sensitive to toxic odors in drinking water or swimming pools? The answer is simple. The effect of disinfecting with chlorine is only exerted in clear water, and we need to focus on the analysis of residual chlorine that is important for instrumental analysis.

As with other viruses, mutation occurring in the virus’s genomes can have functional consequences and may alter viral infectivity. ABSTRACT Tobamoviruses are agriculturally relevant viruses that cause crop losses and have infected plants in many regions of the world. These viruses are frequently found in municipal wastewater, likely coming from human diet and industrial waste across wastewater catchment areas. As part of a large wastewater-based epidemiology study across Southern California, we analyzed RNA sequence data from 275 influent wastewater samples obtained from eight wastewater treatment plants with a catchment area of approximately 16 million people from July 2020 to August 2021. We assembled 1,083 high-quality genomes, enumerated viral sequencing reads, and detected thousands of single nucleotide variants from eight common tobamoviruses: bell pepper mottle virus, cucumber green mottle mosaic virus, pepper mild mottle virus, tobacco mild green mosaic virus, tomato brown rugose fruit virus, tomato mosaic virus, tomato mottle mosaic virus, and tropical soda apple mosaic virus. We show that single nucleotide variants had amino acid-altering consequences along with synonymous mutations, which represents potential evolution with functional consequences in genomes of these viruses. Our study shows the importance of wastewater sequencing to monitor the genomic diversity of these plant-infecting viruses, and we suggest that our data could be used to continue tracking the genomic variability of such pathogens.

Several explanations for the development of cardiovascular complications during and after acute COVID-19 infection have been hypothesized. The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has emerged as one of the deadliest pandemics in modern history. The myocardial injury in COVID-19 patients has been associated with coronary spasm, microthrombi formation, plaque rupture, hypoxic injury, or cytokine storm, which have the same pathophysiology as the three clinical variants of Kounis syndrome. The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), renin-aldosterone system (RAAS), and kinin-kallikrein system are the main proposed mechanisms contributing to cardiovascular complications with the COVID-19 infection. ACE receptors can be found in the heart, blood vessels, endothelium, lungs, intestines, testes, neurons, and other human body parts. SARS-CoV-2 directly invades the endothelial cells with ACE2 receptors and constitutes the main pathway through which the virus enters the endothelial cells. This causes angiotensin II accumulation downregulation of the ACE2 receptors, resulting in prothrombotic effects, such as hemostatic imbalance via activation of the coagulation cascade, impaired fibrinolysis, thrombin generation, vasoconstriction, endothelial and platelet activation, and pro-inflammatory cytokine release. The KKS system typically causes vasodilation and regulates tissue repair, inflammation, cell proliferation, and platelet aggregation, but SARS-CoV-2 infection impairs such counterbalancing effects. This cascade results in cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, cardiomyopathy, cytokine storm, heart failure, ischemic myocardial injuries, microvascular disease, Kounis syndrome, prolonged COVID, myocardial fibrosis, myocarditis, new-onset hypertension, pericarditis, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, pulmonary hypertension, stroke, Takotsubo syndrome, venous thromboembolism, and thrombocytopenia.

The “coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)” outbreak, caused by the virus “Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)”, corresponds to the current and global pandemic, characterized by several developing variants, many of which are classified as variants of concern (VOCs) by the “World Health Organization (WHO, Geneva, Switzerland)”. The primary diagnosis of infection is made using either the molecular technique of RT-PCR, which detects parts of the viral genome’s RNA, or immunodiagnostic procedures, which identify viral proteins or antibodies generated by the host. As the demand for the RT-PCR test grew fast, several inexperienced producers joined the market with innovative kits, and an increasing number of laboratories joined the diagnostic field, rendering the test results increasingly prone to mistakes. It is difficult to determine how the outcomes of one unnoticed result could influence decisions about patient quarantine and social isolation, particularly when the patients themselves are health care providers. The development of point-of-care testing helps in the rapid in-field diagnosis of the disease, and such testing can also be used as a bedside monitor for mapping the progression of the disease in critical patients. In this review, we have provided the readers with available molecular diagnostic techniques and their pitfalls in detecting emerging VOCs of SARS-CoV-2, and lastly, we have discussed AI-ML- and nanotechnology-based smart diagnostic techniques for SARS-CoV-2 detection.",Vaccines,2023,secondary,doi:10.3390/vaccines11020374,36851252,9960989,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/vaccines11020374,
doi:10.7554/eLife.86002,Pathogenic mechanisms of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC),"COVID-19, with persistent and new onset of symptoms such as fatigue, post-exertional malaise, and cognitive dysfunction that last for months and impact everyday functioning, is referred to as Long COVID under the general category of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). PASC is highly heterogenous and may be associated with multisystem tissue damage/dysfunction including acute encephalitis, cardiopulmonary syndromes, fibrosis, hepatobiliary damages, gastrointestinal dysregulation, myocardial infarction, neuromuscular syndromes, neuropsychiatric disorders, pulmonary damage, renal failure, stroke, and vascular endothelial dysregulation. A better understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying PASC is essential to guide prevention and treatment. This review addresses potential mechanisms and hypotheses that connect SARS-CoV-2 infection to long-term health consequences. Comparisons between PASC and other virus-initiated chronic syndromes such as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome will be addressed. Aligning symptoms with other chronic syndromes and identifying potentially regulated common underlining pathways may be necessary for understanding the true nature of PASC. The discussed contributors to PASC symptoms include sequelae from acute SARS-CoV-2 injury to one or more organs, persistent reservoirs of the replicating virus or its remnants in several tissues, re-activation of latent pathogens such as Epstein–Barr and herpes viruses in COVID-19 immune-dysregulated tissue environment, SARS-CoV-2 interactions with host microbiome/virome communities, clotting/coagulation dysregulation, dysfunctional brainstem/vagus nerve signaling, dysautonomia or autonomic dysfunction, ongoing activity of primed immune cells, and autoimmunity due to molecular mimicry between pathogen and host proteins. The individualized nature of PASC symptoms suggests that different therapeutic approaches may be required to best manage specific patients.",eLife,2023,secondary,doi:10.7554/eLife.86002,36947108,10032659,https://doi.org/doi:10.7554/eLife.86002,

Advanced μGC systems may incorporate more than 15 elements and operate these elements in different coordinated sequences to execute complex operations. In particular, the control software must manage the sampling and analysis operations of the μGC system in a time-sensitive manner; while operating multiple control loops, it must also manage error conditions, data acquisition, and user interactions when necessary. To address these challenges, this work describes the investigation of multithreaded control software and its evaluation with a representative μGC system. The μGC system is based on a progressive cellular architecture that uses multiple μGC cells to efficiently broaden the range of chemical analytes, with each cell incorporating multiple detectors. Implemented in Python language version 3.7.3 and executed by an embedded single-board computer, the control software enables the concurrent control of heaters, pumps, and valves while also gathering data from thermistors, pressure sensors, capacitive detectors, and photoionization detectors. A graphical user interface (UI) that operates on a laptop provides visualization of control parameters in real time. In experimental evaluations, the control software provided successful operation and readout for all the components, including eight sets of thermistors and heaters that form temperature feedback loops, two sets of pressure sensors and tunable gas pumps that form pressure head feedback loops, six capacitive detectors, three photoionization detectors, six valves, and an additional fixed-flow gas pump. A typical run analyzing 18 chemicals is presented. Although the operating system does not guarantee real-time operation, the relative standard deviations of the control loop timings were <0.5%.

We report autosomal recessive deficiencies of OAS1, OAS2, or RNASEL in five unrelated children with MIS-C. The cytosolic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)– sensing OAS1 and OAS2 generate 2′-5′-linked oligoadenylates (2–5A) that activate the singlestranded RNA–degrading ribonuclease L (RNase L). Monocytic cell lines and primary myeloid cells with OAS1, OAS2, or RNase L deficiencies produce excessive amounts of inflammatory cytokines upon dsRNA or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) stimulation. Exogenous 2–5A suppresses cytokine production in OAS1-deficient but not RNase L–deficient cells. Cytokine production in RNase L–deficient cells is impaired by MDA5 or RIG-I deficiency and abolished by mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) deficiency. Recessive OAS–RNase L deficiencies in these patients unleash the production of SARSCoV-2–triggered, MAVS-mediated inflammatory cytokines by mononuclear phagocytes, thereby underlying MIS-C.",Pediatrics,2023,secondary,doi:10.1542/peds.2023-064344PF,38038502,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1542/peds.2023-064344PF,

Here, we reported an integrated active enrichment platform for direct hand-held detection of nucleic acid of COVID-19 in nanoliter samples without PCR. The platform consists of a capillary-assisted liquid-carrying system for sampling, integrated circuit system for ultrasound output, and cell-phone-based surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) system. Considering the acoustic responsiveness and SERS-enhanced performance, gold nanorods were selected for biomedical applications. Functionalized gold nanorods can effectively capture and enrich biomarkers under ultrasonic aggregation. Such approaches can actively assemble gold nanorods in 1–2 s and achieved highly sensitive (6.15 × 10–13 M) SERS detection of COVID-19 biomarkers in nanoliter (10–7 L) samples within 5 min.

We documented a significant elevation of IFN-{gamma}, but not IFN- and IFN-{lambda} in MIS-C patients. BAFF was elevated in MIS-C patient sera and accompanied by decreased BAFFR expression on all B cell subtypes. The proportion of plasmablasts was significantly lower in patients compared to healthy post-COVID children. We noted the presence of ENA Ro60 autoantibodies in 4/35 tested MIS-C patients.

It is estimated that about 0.06% of these patients may develop MIS‐C, representing more than 2 million children worldwide. This systematic review and meta‐analysis examined the pooled prevalence of cardiovascular manifestation and cardiac complications in children hospitalised with MIS‐C. The PROSPERO register number is CRD42022327212. We included case‐report studies, case‐control studies, cohort studies, and cross‐sectional studies, as well as clinical trials or studies describing cardiac manifestations of MIS‐C and its sequelae in a paediatric population. Initially, 285 studies were selected, but there were 154 duplicates, and 81 were excluded because they did not fit the eligibility criteria. Thus, 50 studies were selected for review, and 30 were included in the meta‐analysis. A total sample size of 1445 children was included. The combined prevalence of myocarditis or pericarditis was 34.3% (95% CI: 25.0%–44.2%). The combined prevalence for echocardiogram anomalies was 40.8% (95% CI: 30.5%–51.5%), that of Kawasaki disease presentation was 14.8% (95% CI: 7.5%–23.7%), and that of coronary dilation was 15.2% (95% CI: 11.0%–19.8%).

We aimed to determine the association between SARS-CoV-2 contamination on high-touch environmental surfaces, community level case incidence, and university student health data. Environmental swabs were collected from January 2022 to November 2022 from high-touch objects and surfaces from five locations on a large university campus in Florida, USA. RT-qPCR was used to detect and quantify viral RNA, and a subset of positive samples was analyzed by viral genome sequencing to identify circulating lineages. During the study period, we detected SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA on 90.7% of 162 tested samples. Levels of environmental viral RNA correlated with trends in community-level activity and case reports from the student health center. A significant positive correlation was observed between the estimated viral gene copy number in environmental samples and the weekly confirmed cases at the university. Viral sequencing data from environmental samples identified lineages contemporaneously circulating in the local community and state based on genomic surveillance data. Further, we detected emerging variants in environmental samples prior to their identification by clinical genomic surveillance. Our results demonstrate the utility of viral monitoring on high-touch environmental surfaces for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance at a community level.

We developed representative maps from public EMP 16S rRNA amplicon sequences microbiomics data. Streptomyces ASVs were extracted from the EMP overall bacterial community, demonstrating Streptomyces diversity and identifying crucial diversity patterns. Our findings revealed that while the EMP primarily distinguished bacterial communities as host-associated or free-living (EMPO level 1), the Streptomyces community showed no significant difference but exhibited distinctions between categories in EMPO level 2 (animal, plant, non-saline, and saline). Multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated that pH, temperature, and salinity significantly predicted Streptomyces richness, with richness decreasing as these factors increased. However, latitude and longitude do not predict Streptomyces richness. Our Streptomyces maps revealed that additional samplings in Africa and Southeast Asia are needed. Additionally, our findings indicated that a greater number of samples did not always result in greater Streptomyces richness; future surveys may not necessitate extensive sampling from a single location. Broader sampling, rather than local/regional sampling, may be more critical in answering microbial biogeograph questions. Lastly, using 16S rRNA gene sequencing data has some limitations, which should be interpreted cautiously.",Life,2023,secondary,doi:10.3390/life14010011,38276260,10821021,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/life14010011,

The typical logic operations such as OR, YES, AND, INHIBIT, NOR, and NAND gate, are conveniently and clearly executed with this DNA machine through rational design of the input and computing elements. Moreover, by integrating the target recognition module with the CCC module, the proposed DNA machine is further employed in the homogeneous detection of apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1). The precise recognition and exponential signal amplification facilitated the highly selective and sensitive detection of APE1 with limit of detection (LOD) of 7.8 × 10-5 U mL-1 .

Herein, we present design principle, synthesis, and characterization of a DNA nanorobotic hand, called the “NanoGripper”, that contains a palm and four bendable fingers as inspired by human hands, bird claws, and bacteriophages evolved in nature. Each NanoGripper finger has three phalanges connected by two flexible and rotatable joints that are bendable in response to binding to other entities. Functions of the NanoGripper have been enabled and driven by the interactions between moieties attached to the fingers and their binding partners. We showcase that the NanoGripper can be engineered to interact with and capture various objects with different dimensions, including gold nanoparticles, gold NanoUrchins, and SARS-CoV-2 virions. When carrying multiple DNA aptamer nanoswitches programmed to generate fluorescent signal enhanced on a photonic crystal platform, the NanoGripper functions as a sensitive viral biosensor that detects intact SARS-CoV-2 virions in human saliva with a limit of detection of ∼ 100 copies/mL, providing RT-PCR equivalent sensitivity. Additionally, we use confocal microscopy to visualize how the NanoGripper-aptamer complex can effectively block viral entry into the host cells, indicating the viral inhibition.

Herein, a dynamic DNA nanosystem-integrated ratiometric electrochemical biosensor was proposed to determine human immunodeficiency virus-associated DNA fragment (HIV-DNA) with high sensitivity and selectivity. The dynamic DNA nanosystem was composed of a target recycling unit and a multipedal DNA walker unit. Both of them could be driven by a toehold-mediated strand displacement reaction, enabling an enzyme-free and isothermal amplification strategy for nucleic acid determination. The target recycling unit could selectively recognize HIV-DNA and activate the multipedal DNA walker unit to roll on the electrode surface, which would lead to bidirectional signal variation for ratiometric readout with cascade signal amplification. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of the dynamic DNA nanosystem and the ratiometric output mode, the ultrasensitive detection of HIV-DNA was achieved in a wide linear range of 6 orders of magnitude with a limit of detection of 36.71 aM. The actual usability of the proposed sensor was also verified in complex biological samples with acceptable performance.

Patients receiving dialysis are at higher risk for severe respiratory infections, including SARS-CoV-2 (the causative agent of COVID-19). In addition, many patients who receive dialysis also receive immunosuppressive treatments for conditions such as systemic vasculitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or malignancies. Many studies have shown that while mRNA COVID-19 vaccines induce some level of immune response in patients receiving dialysis, the magnitude of response is often lower than that of healthy individuals, and responses rapidly wane. Importantly, the risk of COVID-19–related hospitalization and mortality for patients receiving dialysis is 4- to 8-fold higher compared with the general population. In this article, we summarize recent immunogenicity and real-world outcomes of COVID-19 mRNA vaccination among patients receiving dialysis, with a focus on the 3-dose extended primary series and additional (fourth) doses.",The Journal of Infectious Diseases,2023,secondary,doi:10.1093/infdis/jiad162,37539761,10401621,https://doi.org/doi:10.1093/infdis/jiad162,
doi:10.1128/mbio.03101-22,"Baseline Sequencing Surveillance of Public Clinical Testing, Hospitals, and Community Wastewater Reveals Rapid Emergence of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron Variant of Concern in Arizona, USA","SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve new variants throughout the pandemic. However, the temporal dynamics of how SARS-CoV-2 variants emerge to become the dominant circulating variant is not precisely known. ABSTRACT The adaptive evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants is driven by selection for increased viral fitness in transmissibility and immune evasion. Understanding the dynamics of how an emergent variant sweeps across populations can better inform public health response preparedness for future variants. Here, we investigated the state-level genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 through baseline genomic sequencing surveillance of 27,071 public testing specimens and 1,125 hospital inpatient specimens diagnosed between November 1, 2021, and January 31, 2022, in Arizona. We found that the Omicron variant rapidly displaced Delta variant in December 2021, leading to an “Omicron surge” of COVID-19 cases in early 2022. Wastewater sequencing surveillance of 370 samples supported the synchronous sweep of Omicron in the community. Hospital inpatient COVID-19 cases of Omicron variant presented to three major hospitals 10.51 days after its detection from public clinical testing. Nonsynonymous mutations in nsp3, nsp12, and nsp13 genes were significantly associated with Omicron hospital cases compared to community cases. To model SARS-CoV-2 transmissions across the state population, we developed a scalable sequence network methodology and showed that the Omicron variant spread through intracounty and intercounty transmissions. Finally, we demonstrated that the temporal emergence of Omicron BA.1 to become the dominant variant (17.02 days) was 2.3 times faster than the prior Delta variant (40.70 days) or subsequent Omicron sublineages BA.2 (39.65 days) and BA.5 (35.38 days). Our results demonstrate the uniquely rapid sweep of Omicron BA.1. These findings highlight how integrated public health surveillance can be used to enhance preparedness and response to future variants. IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve new variants throughout the pandemic. However, the temporal dynamics of how SARS-CoV-2 variants emerge to become the dominant circulating variant is not precisely known. Genomic sequencing surveillance offers unique insights into how SARS-CoV-2 spreads in communities and the lead-up to hospital cases during a surge. Specifically, baseline sequencing surveillance through random selection of positive diagnostic specimens provides a representative outlook of the virus lineages circulating in a geographic region. Here, we investigated the emergence of the Omicron variant of concern in Arizona by leveraging baseline genomic sequence surveillance of public clinical testing, hospitals, and community wastewater. We tracked the spread and evolution of the Omicron variant as it first emerged in the general public, and its rapid shift in hospital admissions in the state health system. This study demonstrates the timescale of public health preparedness needed to respond to an antigenic shift in SARS-CoV-2.",mBio,2023,secondary,doi:10.1128/mbio.03101-22,36622143,9972916,https://doi.org/doi:10.1128/mbio.03101-22,

More specifically, RNA levels determined with RT-qPCR have been shown to track with the infection dynamics within the population. However, the surveillance of individual lineages circulating in the population based on genomic sequencing of wastewater samples is challenging, as the genetic material constitutes a mixture of different viral haplotypes. Here, we identify specific signature mutations from individual SARS-CoV-2 lineages in wastewater samples to estimate lineages circulating in Luxembourg. We compare circulating lineages and mutations to those detected in clinical samples amongst infected individuals. We show that especially for dominant lineages, the allele frequencies of signature mutations correspond to the occurrence of particular lineages in the population. In addition, we provide evidence that regional clusters can also be discerned. We focused on the time period between November 2020 and March 2021 in which several variants of concern emerged and specifically traced the lineage B.1.1.7, which became dominant in Luxembourg during that time. During the subsequent time points, we were able to reconstruct short haplotypes, highlighting the co-occurrence of several signature mutations. Our results highlight the potential of genomic surveillance in wastewater samples based on amplicon short-read data. By extension, our work provides the basis for the early detection of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants.",Water,2021,secondary,doi:10.3390/w13213018,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/w13213018,

Development of specific therapy and biosensors is complicated by an emergence of new viral strains bearing amino acid substitutions and probable differences in glycosylation sites. Here, we studied affinity of a set of aptamers to two Wuhan-type RBD of S-protein expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cell line and Pichia pastoris that differ in glycosylation patterns. The expression system for the RBD protein has significant effects, both on values of dissociation constants and relative efficacy of the aptamer binding. We propose glycosylation of the RBD as the main force for observed differences. Moreover, affinity of a several aptamers was affected by a site of biotinylation. Thus, the robustness of modified aptamers toward new virus variants should be carefully tested.",International Journal of Molecular Sciences,2022,secondary,doi:10.3390/ijms23010557,35008982,8745424,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/ijms23010557,

Here we leveraged a large set of MIS-C patient samples (n=199) to identify a distinct set of host proteins that are differentially targeted by patient autoantibodies relative to matched controls. We identified an autoreactive epitope within SNX8, a protein expressed primarily in immune cells which regulates an antiviral pathway associated with MIS-C pathogenesis. In parallel, we also probed the SARS-CoV-2 proteome-wide MIS-C patient antibody response and found it to be differentially reactive to a distinct domain of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein relative to controls. This viral N region and the mapped SNX8 epitope bear remarkable biochemical similarity. Furthermore, we find that many children with anti-SNX8 autoantibodies also have T-cells cross-reactive to both SNX8 and this distinct domain of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein. Together, these findings suggest that MIS-C patients develop a distinct immune response against the SARS-CoV-2 N protein that is associated with cross reactivity to the self-protein SNX8, demonstrating a link from the infection to the inflammatory syndrome.",,2023,secondary,doi:10.1101/2023.05.26.23290373,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2023.05.26.23290373,

The total nucleic acid contents of samples from 159 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were subjected to whole genome sequencing. The SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from these patients were examined for variants in spike protein RBD. In January 2021, three family members (one aged in their 40s and two aged under 10 years old) were found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 harboring W152L/E484K/G769V mutations. These three patients were living in Japan and had no history of traveling abroad. After identifying these cases, we developed a TaqMan assay to screen for the above hallmark mutations and identified an additional 14 patients with the same mutations. The associated virus strain was classified into the GR clade (Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data [GISAID]), 20B clade (Nextstrain), and R.1 lineage (Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak [PANGO] Lineages).

It is also being used for tracking the SARS-CoV-2 at the population level. This article aims to compile and assess the information for the qualitative and quantitative detection of the SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater. Based on the globally published studies, we highlight the importance of monitoring SARS-CoV-2 presence/detection in the wastewater and concurrently emphasize the development of early surveillance techniques. SARS-CoV-2 RNA sheds in the human feces, saliva, sputum and mucus that ultimately reaches to the wastewater and brings viral RNA into it. For the detection of the virus in the wastewater, different detection techniques have been optimized and are in use. These are based on serological, biosensor, targeted PCR, and next generation sequencing for whole genome sequencing or targeted amplicon sequencing. The presence of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater could be used as a potential tool for early detection and devising the strategies for eradication of the virus before it is spread in the community. Additionally, with the right and timely understanding of viral behavior in the environment, an accurate and instructive model that leverages WBE-derived data may be created. This might help with the creation of technological tools and doable plans of action to lessen the negative effects of current viral epidemics or future potential outbreaks on public health and the economy.

However, nanomaterials with efficient tumor accumulation have been less exploited for effective radionuclide-based therapy. Here, we report glycol chitosan-based nanoparticles (GCP-NPs) with acidic pH-dependent surface charge conversion for efficient radionuclide-based combination therapy. The nanoplatform can change the surface charge of nanoparticles from slight negative to positive in the acidic tumor microenvironment, which facilitates cellular internalization and penetration and thus improves the tumor accumulation efficiency of nanomaterials.

Afterward, therapeutic radioisotope 177Lu-labeled GCP-NPs (177Lu-GCP-NPs) that utilize RNT synergistic with photodynamic therapy (PDT) derived from conjugated pyropheophorbide-a within nanoparticles endow superior antitumor efficacy in living cells and tumor-bearing mouse model. More importantly, the combination of RNT and PDT using 177Lu-GCP-NPs can effectively inhibit lung metastasis and eliminate splenomegaly, which is not possible for individual RNT or PDT.

Proportions of these variants circulating in a human population are typically estimated by large-scale sequencing of individual patient samples. Sequencing a mixture of SARS-CoV-2 RNA molecules from wastewater provides a cost-effective alternative, but requires methods for estimating variant proportions in a mixed sample. Results We propose a new method based on a probabilistic model of sequencing reads, capturing sequence diversity present within individual variants, as well as sequencing errors. The algorithm is implemented in an open source Python program called VirPool. We evaluate the accuracy of VirPool on several simulated and real sequencing data sets from both Illumina and nanopore sequencing platforms, including wastewater samples from Austria and France monitoring the onset of the Alpha variant. Conclusions VirPool is a versatile tool for wastewater and other mixed-sample analysis that can handle both short- and long-read sequencing data. Our approach does not require pre-selection of characteristic mutations for variant profiles, it is able to use the entire length of reads instead of just the most informative positions, and can also capture haplotype dependencies within a single read.",BMC Bioinformatics,2022,secondary,doi:10.1101/2022.06.21.22276717,36536300,9761630,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2022.06.21.22276717,

Materials and Methods: This is a prospective case–control study that included children diagnosed to have MIS-C in the postoperative period based on clinical signs, rise in inflammatory markers, and echocardiographic features of ventricular dysfunction or coronary involvement. Management included intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), steroids, and antiplatelet medications in addition to routine postoperative care. Out of the 461 children who underwent surgery for CHD between April 1st, 2021, and November 30th, 2021, 18 children were diagnosed with MIS-C. After the initial routine postoperative course, all 18 children had sudden worsening in clinical and laboratory parameters. Other causes such as bacterial infection were ruled out. All of these children had features of MIS-C with ventricular dilatation and dysfunction, coronary artery involvement, and reactive COVID-19 immunoglobulin G antibody. There was a significant improvement in coronary artery dimensions after IVIG a ministration (P = 0.001). The involvement of the left main coronary artery was associated with significantly increased length of intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stay (P = 0.019). Mean ICU and hospital stay was prolonged in the MIS-C group. There were two deaths in this group due to severe left ventricular dysfunction. Conclusions: During the pandemic, a proportion of patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery may develop unexpected worsening in clinical status due to MIS-C. A high index of suspicion and prompt treatment with IVIG and steroids may be helpful in improving outcomes.",Annals of Pediatric Cardiology,2023,secondary,doi:10.4103/apc.apc_111_22,37767163,10522151,https://doi.org/doi:10.4103/apc.apc_111_22,

This study aimed to clarify the clinical courses and outcomes of CD patients in the first COVID-19 wave after the end of “zero-COVID” policy in China. Methods Clinical characteristics, including vaccination doses and medications of 880 CD patients from a prospective cohort were collected for analysis. Results Of the enrolled patients (n = 880) who underwent nucleic acid or antigen testing for COVID-19 from Dec 7, 2022, to Jan 7, 2023, 779 (88.5%) were infected with COVID-19. Among the infected patients, 755 (96.9%) were mild, 14 (1.8%) were moderate, one patient with leukemia died of cerebral hemorrhage (mortality, 0.1%) and only 9 (1.2%) were asymptomatic. Fever, cough, headache and appetite loss were the most frequently observed symptoms in general, respiratory, neurological and gastrointestinal manifestations, respectively. The age and disease duration were significantly higher (40/32, 5.6/3.6, all p < 0.05) in moderate patients than those in mild patients. All other clinical characteristics, including CD activity and medication exposure, showed no significant differences between the above two groups. Furthermore, no significant difference in vaccination or comorbidities was observed between the two groups. Conclusion Most CD patients contracted the Omicron infection and experienced mild disease courses in the first COVID-19 wave attack after China ended the “zero-COVID” policy irrespective of vaccination dose or comorbidities.",Frontiers in Public Health,2023,secondary,doi:10.3389/fpubh.2023.1186275,37521974,10373865,https://doi.org/doi:10.3389/fpubh.2023.1186275,

doi:10.3390/bios13090858,Heterogeneous-Nucleation Biosensor for Long-Term Collection and Mask-Based Self-Detection of SARS-CoV-2,"The effective control of infectious diseases, including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, depends on the availability of rapid and accurate monitoring techniques. However, conventional SARS-CoV-2 detection technologies do not support continuous self-detection and may lead to cross-infection when utilized in medical institutions. In this study, we introduce a prototype of a mask biosensor designed for the long-term collection and self-detection of SARS-CoV-2. The biosensor utilizes the average resonance Rayleigh scattering intensity of Au nanocluster-aptamers. The inter-mask surface serves as a medium for the long-term collection and concentration enhancement of SARS-CoV-2, while the heterogeneous-nucleation nanoclusters (NCs) contribute to the exceptional stability of Au NCs for up to 48 h, facilitated by the adhesion of Ti NCs. Additionally, the biosensors based on Au NC-aptamers exhibited high sensitivity for up to 1 h. Moreover, through the implementation of a support vector machine classifier, a significant number of point signals can be collected and differentiated, leading to improved biosensor accuracy. These biosensors offer a complementary wearable device-based method for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2, with a limit of detection of 103 copies. Given their flexibility, the proposed biosensors possess tremendous potential for the continuous collection and sensitive self-detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants and other infectious pathogens.",Biosensors,2023,secondary,doi:10.3390/bios13090858,37754092,10526364,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/bios13090858,

The need for SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific data stimulated considerable research in this regard. Overall, SARS‐CoV‐2 is practically and equally susceptible to approaches for disinfection and decontamination that have been previously found for other human or animal coronaviruses. The latter have included techniques utilizing temperature modulation, pH extremes, irradiation, and chemical treatments. These physicochemical methods are a necessary adjunct to other prevention strategies, given the environmental and patient surface ubiquity of the virus. Classic studies of disinfection have also allowed for extrapolation to the eradication of the virus on human mucosal surfaces by some chemical means. Despite considerable laboratory study, practical field assessments are generally lacking and need to be encouraged to confirm the correlation of interventions with viral eradication and infection prevention.

Methods: Workers of a sewing company (Lithuania) with known SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR result during the outbreak (April 2020) were invited to participate in the study. Virus-specific IgG and IgM were monitored 2, 6 and 13 months after the outbreak via rapid IgG/IgM serological test and SARS-CoV-2 S protein-specific IgG ELISA. Results: Six months after the outbreak, 95% (CI 86–99%) of 59 previously infected individuals had virus-specific antibodies irrespective of the severity of infection. One-third of seropositive individuals had virus-specific IgM along with IgG indicating that IgM may persist for 6 months. Serological testing 13 months after the outbreak included 47 recovered individuals that remained non-vaccinated despite a wide accessibility of COVID-19 vaccines. The seropositivity rate was 83% (CI 69–91%) excluding one case of confirmed asymptomatic reinfection in this group. Between months 6 and 13, IgG levels either declined or remained stable in 31 individual and increased in 7 individuals possibly indicating an exposure to SARS-CoV-2 during the second wave of the pandemic.

Despite technological advances, 90 years after the development of the first molecule for the treatment of IBD, we still do not have drugs that promote disease remission in a generalized way. We carried out a narrative review on therapeutic advances in the treatment of IBD, the mechanisms of action, and the challenges facing the therapeutic goals in the treatment of IBD. Salicylates are still used in the treatment of Ulcerative Colitis. Corticosteroids have an indication restricted to the period of therapeutic induction due to frequent adverse events, while technologies with less systemic action have been developed. Most immunomodulators showed a late onset of action, requiring a differentiated initial strategy to control the disease. New therapeutic perspectives emerged with biological therapy, initially with anti-TNF, followed by anti-integrins and anti-interleukins. Despite the different mechanisms of action, there are similarities between the general rates of effectiveness. These similar results were also evidenced in JAK inhibitors and S1p modulators, the last therapeutic classes approved for the treatment of IBD.",Pharmaceuticals,2023,secondary,doi:10.3390/ph16091272,37765080,10537095,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/ph16091272,
doi:10.1101/2023.10.08.561395,Lethal COVID-19 Associates With RAAS-Induced Inflammation For Multiple Organ Damage Including Mediastinal Lymph Nodes,"Lethal COVID-19 outcomes are most often attributed to classic cytokine storm and attendant excessive immune signaling. We re-visit this question using RNA sequencing in nasopharyngeal and 40 autopsy samples from COVID-19-positive and negative individuals. In nasal swabs, the top 100 genes which significantly correlated with COVID-19 viral load, include many canonical innate immune genes. However, 22 much less studied ""non-canonical"" genes are found and despite the absence of viral transcripts, subsets of these are upregulated in heart, lung, kidney, and liver, but not mediastinal lymph nodes. An important regulatory potential emerges for the non-canonical genes for over-activating the renin-angiotensin-activation-system (RAAS) pathway, resembling this phenomenon in hereditary angioedema (HAE) and its overlapping multiple features with lethal COVID-19 infections. Specifically, RAAS overactivation links increased fibrin deposition, leaky vessels, thrombotic tendency, and initiating the PANoptosis death pathway, as suggested in heart, lung, and especially mediastinal lymph nodes, with a tightly associated mitochondrial dysfunction linked to immune responses. For mediastinal lymph nodes, immunohistochemistry studies validate the transcriptomic findings showing abnormal architecture, excess fibrin and collagen deposition, and pathogenic fibroblasts. Further, our findings overlap findings in SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters, C57BL/6 and BALB/c mouse models, and importantly peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) and whole blood samples from COVID-19 patients infected with early variants and later SARS-CoV-2 strains. We thus present cytokine storm in lethal COVID-19 disease as an interplay between upstream immune gene signaling producing downstream RAAS overactivation with resultant severe organ damage, especially compromising mediastinal lymph node function.",bioRxiv,2023,secondary,doi:10.1101/2023.10.08.561395,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2023.10.08.561395,

doi:10.3390/v15030701,Elevated SARS-CoV-2-Specific Antibody Levels in Patients with Post-COVID Syndrome,"With the routine use of effective severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines, the number of life-threatening coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) courses have largely been reduced. However, multiple COVID-19 convalescents, even after asymptomatic to moderate disease, suffer from post-COVID syndrome, with relevant limitations in daily life. The pathophysiologic mechanisms of post-COVID syndrome are still elusive, with dysregulation of the immune system suggested as a central mechanism. Here, we assessed COVID-19 post-infectious symptoms (5–6 months after PCR-confirmed acute infection) together with the humoral immune response against SARS-CoV-2 in non-hospitalized COVID-19 convalescents, early (5–6 weeks) and late (5–6 months) after their first positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR result. Convalescents reporting several post-infectious symptoms (>3) showed higher anti-spike and anti-nucleocapsid antibody levels 5–6 weeks after PCR-confirmed infection with the latter remained increased 5–6 months after positive PCR. Likewise, a higher post-infectious symptom score was associated with increased antibody levels. Of note, convalescents displaying neuro-psychiatric symptoms such as restlessness, palpitations, irritability, and headache, as well as general symptoms such as fatigue/reduced power had higher SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody levels compared with asymptomatic cases. The increased humoral immune response in convalescents with post-COVID syndrome might be useful for the detection of individuals with an increased risk for post-COVID syndrome.",Viruses,2023,secondary,doi:10.3390/v15030701,36992410,10051370,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/v15030701,

Concerns from emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and other circulating respiratory viral pathogens further underscore the importance of expanding diagnostic testing to multiplex detection, as single-plex diagnostic testing may fail to detect emerging variants and other viruses, while sequencing can be too slow and too expensive as a diagnostic tool. As a result, there have been significant advances in multiplex nucleic-acid-based virus diagnostic testing, creating a need for a timely review. This review first introduces frequent nucleic acid targets for multiplex virus diagnostic tests, then proceeds to a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of multiplex assays that incorporate various detection reactions and readout modalities. The performances, advantages, and disadvantages of these assays are discussed, followed by highlights of platforms that are amenable for point-of-care use.

These responses were compared to healthy convalescent pediatric COVID-19 patients approximately twenty-eight days after the onset of symptoms. Both groups had strong IgG responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, but the MIS-C patients had weaker antibody responses to certain epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 S and N proteins and to the S and N proteins of endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV) compared to pediatric convalescent COVID patients. HCoV antibody reactivity was correlated with age. In contrast, MIS-C patients had elevated serum levels of several proinflammatory cytokines compared to convalescent COVID patients, including interleukins IL-6, IL-8, IL-18 and chemokines CCL2, CCL8, CXCL5, CXCL9 and CXCL10 as well as tumor necrosis factor alpha and interferon gamma. Moreover, many cytokine responses of MIS-C patients were positively correlated with antibody responses to the SARS-CoV-2 S, N, membrane and ORF3a proteins while pediatric convalescent COVID patient cytokine responses were more often negatively correlated with antibody responses to the S, N and ORF3a proteins of SARS-CoV-2.",bioRxiv,2023,secondary,doi:10.1101/2023.08.28.555120,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2023.08.28.555120,

The COVID-19 pandemic caused economic and public health turbulence around the world. Among the many possibilities for using AI in the medical field is FreeStyle Libre® (FSL), which uses a disposable sensor inserted into the user’s arm, and a touchscreen device/reader is used to scan and retrieve other continuous monitoring of glucose (CMG) readings. The aim of this systematic review is to summarize the effectiveness of FSL blood glucose monitoring during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This systematic review was carried out in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and was registered in the international prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO: CRD42022340562). The inclusion criteria considered studies involving the use of the FSL device during the COVID-19 pandemic and published in English. No publication date restrictions were set. The exclusion criteria were abstracts, systematic reviews, studies with patients with other diseases, monitoring with other equipment, patients with COVID-19, and bariatrics patients. Seven databases were searched (PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, Scielo, PEDro and Cochrane Library). The ACROBAT-NRSI tool (A Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Non-Randomized Studies) was used to evaluate the risk of bias in the selected articles. Results: A total of 113 articles were found. Sixty-four were excluded because they were duplicates, 39 were excluded after reading the titles and abstracts, and twenty articles were considered for full reading. Of the 10 articles analyzed, four articles were excluded because they did not meet the inclusion criteria. Thus, six articles were included in the current systematic review. It was observed that among the selected articles, only two were classified as having serious risk of bias. It was shown that FSL had a positive impact on glycemic control and on reducing the number of individuals with hypoglycemia. Conclusion: The findings suggest that the implementation of FSL during COVID-19 confinement in this population can be confidently stated to have been effective in diabetes mellitus patients.",Diagnostics,2023,secondary,doi:10.3390/diagnostics13081499,37189600,10137815,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/diagnostics13081499,

In 2022, the combination of cilgavimab and tixagevimab (Evusheld, AstraZeneca) was approved for COVID-19 preexposure prophylaxis in high-risk groups. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the humoral response and short-term safety of this antibody combination in a group of HD patients. Materials and Methods: Seventy-three adult maintenance hemodialysis patients were recruited from a tertiary-care hospital for this double-blinded, non-randomized, placebo-controlled study. Patients were placed into two groups: the intervention group (n = 43) received a single 300 mg dosage of cilgavimab and tixagevimab, while the control group (n = 30) received a saline placebo. The titer of COVID-19-neutralizing antibodies was measured at baseline and after 1 and 6 months. The patients were evaluated for any drug-related adverse effects and monitored for six months for the emergence of any COVID-19-related events. Results: Patients in the intervention group were substantially older and had been on HD for longer (p = 0.002 and 0.006, respectively). The baseline antibody levels were higher in the Evusheld group. The antibody level in the intervention group increased significantly after 1 month and remained consistent for 6 months, whereas the antibody level in the control group fell significantly after 6 months during the study period (Wald χ2 = 30.620, p < 0.001). The drug-related adverse effects were modest and well-tolerated, and only seven patients experienced them. Six months after study enrollment, 10 patients in the intervention group and 6 patients in the control group had been infected with COVID-19, respectively. In the control group, ICU admission and mortality were observed, but in the intervention group, the infection was milder with no aggressive consequences. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the short-term safety and efficacy of tixagevimab–cilgavimab for COVID-19 preexposure prophylaxis in HD patients.

As a type of nano‐biosensors, molecular specificity field‐effect transistor (FET) biosensors with signal amplification capability exhibit prominent advantages including fast response speed, ease of miniaturization, and integration, promising their high sensitivity for molecules detection and identification. With intrinsic characteristics of high stability and structural tunability, aptamer has become one of the most commonly applied biological recognition units in the FET sensing fields. This review summarizes the recent progress of FET biosensors based on aptamer functionalized nanomaterials in medical diagnosis and environmental monitoring. The structure, sensing principles, preparation methods, and functionalization strategies of aptamer modified FET biosensors were comprehensively summarized.

Yet, despite their many advantages, the structure and function of synthetic polymers still appear rudimentary compared to biological matter: cells use dynamic self-assembly to construct complex materials and operate sophisticated macromolecular devices. The field of DNA nanotechnology has demonstrated that synthetic DNA molecules can be programmed to undergo predictable self-assembly, offering unparalleled control over the formation and dynamic properties of artificial nanostructures. Intriguingly, the principles of DNA nanotechnology can be applied to the engineering of soft programmable materials, bringing the abilities of synthetic polymers closer to their biological counterparts. In this perspective, we discuss the unique features of DNA-functionalized polymer materials. We describe design principles that allow researchers to build complex supramolecular architectures with predictable and dynamically adjustable material properties. Finally, we highlight two key application areas where this biologically inspired material class offers particularly promising opportunities: (1) as dynamic matrices for 3D cell and organoid culture and (2) as smart materials for nucleic acid sequencing and pathogen detection.",Journal of Polymer Science,2023,secondary,doi:10.1002/pol.20230160,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1002/pol.20230160,

Because bicycling continues to grow in popularity,* primarily among U.S. adults, examining the strategies that mitigate the risk for TBI is important. CDC analyzed data from the National Electronic Injury Sursveillance System-All Injury Program (NEISS-AIP) to determine the incidence of EDs for bicycle-related TBIs during 2009-2018. An estimated 596,972 ED visits for bicycle-related TBIs occurred in the United States during the study period. Rates of ED visits were highest among adult males (aged ≥18 years) and among children and adolescents aged 10-14 years during 2009-2018. Overall, the rate of ED visits for bicycle-related TBIs decreased by approximately one half (48.7%) among children and by 5.5% among adults. As the number of persons riding bicycles increases, expansion of comprehensive bicycling safety interventions for bicyclists and drivers by states and local communities, such as interventions to increase driver compliance with traffic laws and helmet use among riders, improvements in bicycling infrastructure, and customized interventions for males and other groups at high risk might help reduce bicycle-related injuries.",Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report,2021,secondary,doi:10.15585/mmwr.mm7019a1,33988186,8118151,https://doi.org/doi:10.15585/mmwr.mm7019a1,

A mathematical model was used to design a ring electrode-based QCR to eliminate the Gaussian spatial distribution of frequency response in the first harmonic mode, a characteristic of QCRs, without compromising the sensitivity of frequency response. An ink-dot method was used to validate the ring electrode fabricated based on our model. Furthermore, the ring electrode QCR was experimentally tested for its ability to capture circulating tumor cells, and the results were compared with a commercially available QCR with a keyhole electrode. An indirect method of surface immobilization technique was employed via modification of the SiO2 surface of the ring electrode using a silane, protein, and anti-EpCAM. The ring electrode successfully demonstrated eliminating the spatial nonuniformity of frequency response for three cancer cell lines, i.e., MCF-7, PANC-1, and PC-3, compared with the keyhole QCR, which showed nonuniform spatial response for the same cancer cell lines.

A significant uncertainty that would improve the interpretation of wastewater monitoring data is the intensity and timing with which individuals shed RNA from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into wastewater. By combining wastewater and case surveillance data sets from a university campus during a period of heightened surveillance, we inferred that individual shedding of RNA into wastewater peaks on average 6 days (50% uncertainty interval (UI): 6–7; 95% UI: 4–8) following infection, and that wastewater measurements are highly overdispersed [negative binomial dispersion parameter, k = 0.39 (95% credible interval: 0.32–0.48)]. This limits the utility of wastewater surveillance as a leading indicator of secular trends in SARS-CoV-2 transmission during an epidemic, and implies that it could be most useful as an early warning of rising transmission in areas where transmission is low or clinical testing is delayed or of limited capacity.",Epidemiology and Infection,2021,secondary,doi:10.1017/S0950268821002752,35068403,8795777,https://doi.org/doi:10.1017/S0950268821002752,

Despite the unprecedented pace of vaccine development, with six vaccines already in use worldwide, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) across diverse geographic locales suggests herd immunity may fail to eliminate the virus. All three officially designated VOC carry Spike (S) polymorphisms thought to enable escape from neutralizing antibodies elicited during initial waves of the pandemic. Here, we characterize the biological consequences of the ensemble of S mutations present in VOC lineages B.1.1.7 (501Y.V1) and B.1.351 (501Y.V2). Using a replication-competent EGFP-reporter vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) system, rcVSV-CoV2-S, which encodes S from SARS coronavirus 2 in place of VSV-G, coupled with a clonal HEK-293T ACE2 TMPRSS2 cell line optimized for highly efficient S-mediated infection, we determined that 8 out of 12 (75%) of serum samples from 12 recipients of the Russian Sputnik V Ad26 / Ad5 vaccine showed dose response curve slopes indicative of failure to neutralize rcVSV-CoV2-S: B.1.351. The same set of sera efficiently neutralized S from B.1.1.7 and showed only moderately reduced activity against S carrying the E484K substitution alone.

Hence, engineering the human skin microbiome to synthesize less of mosquito attractants or produce repellents could potentially reduce bites and prevent the transmission of deadly mosquito-borne pathogens. In order to further characterize the human skin volatilome, we quantified the major volatiles of 39 strains of skin commensals (Staphylococci and Corynebacterium). Importantly, to validate the behavioral activity of these volatiles, we first assessed landing behavior triggered by human skin bacteria volatiles. We demonstrated that this behavioral step is gated by the presence of carbon dioxide and L-(+)-lactic acid, similar to the combinatorial coding triggering short range attraction. Repellency behavior to selected skin volatiles and the geraniol terpene was tested in the presence of carbon dioxide and L-(+)-lactic acid. In a 2-choice landing behavior context, the skin volatiles 2- and 3-methyl butyric acids reduced mosquito landing by 62.0-81.6% and 87.1-99.6%, respectively. Similarly, geraniol was capable of reducing mosquito landing behavior by 74.9%. We also tested the potential repellency effects of geraniol on mosquitoes at short-range using a 4-port olfactometer. In these assays, geraniol reduced mosquito attraction (69-78%) to a mixture of key human kairomones carbon dioxide, L-(+)-lactic acid, and ammonia. These findings demonstrate that carbon dioxide and L-(+)-lactic acid changes the valence of other skin volatiles towards mosquito landing behavior. Moreover, this study offers candidate odorants to be targeted in a novel strategy to reduce attractants or produce repellents by the human skin microbiota that may curtail mosquito bites, and subsequent mosquito-borne disease.",bioRxiv,2023,secondary,doi:10.1101/2023.08.19.553996,37662338,10473644,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2023.08.19.553996,

Superantigen specificity for different Vβ-chains results in Vβ-skewing, whereby T cells with specific Vβ-chains and diverse antigen specificity are overrepresented in the TCR repertoire. Here, we characterized the TCR repertoire of MIS-C patients and found a profound expansion of TCR Βeta Variable gene (TRBV)11-2, with up to 24% of clonal T cell space occupied by TRBV11-2 T cells, which correlated with MIS-C severity and serum cytokine levels. Analysis of TRBJ gene usage and CDR3 length distribution of MIS-C expanded TRBV11-2 clones revealed extensive junctional diversity. Patients with TRBV11-2 expansion showed HLA class I allele restriction to HLA-I A02, C35 and C04, indicating a novel mechanism for CDR3-independent T cell expansion. In silico modelling indicated that polyacidic residues in the Vβ chain encoded by TRBV11-2 strongly interact with the superantigen-like motif of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, suggesting that unprocessed SARS-CoV-2 spike may directly mediate TRBV11-2 expansion. Overall, our data indicate that a CDR3-independent interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike and TCR leads to T cell expansion and possibly activation, which may account for the clinical presentation of MIS-C.",The Journal of clinical investigation,2021,secondary,doi:10.1172/JCI146614,33705359,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1172/JCI146614,

RBD9.1 can be recognized by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescent serum, particularly for those with high neutralizing potency. Immunization with RBD9.1 can successfully induce the production of the receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific antibodies in Balb/c mice. Importantly, the immunized sera exhibit sustained neutralizing efficacy against multiple dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant strains, including B.1.617.2 that carries a point mutation (SL452R) within the sequence of RBD9.1. Specifically, SY451 and SY454 are identified as the key amino acids for the binding of the induced RBD-specific antibodies to RBD9.1. Furthermore, we have confirmed that the RBD9.1 antigenic peptide can induce a S448-456 (NYNYLYRLF)-specific CD8+ T-cell response. Both RBD9.1-specific B cells and the S448-456-specific T cells can still be activated more than 3 months post the last immunization.

These wastewater sequences have harbored many of the same variants that later emerged in Omicron. If these enigmatic sequences are human-derived and transmissible, they could both be a source of future variants and a valuable tool for forecasting sequences that should be incorporated into vaccines and therapeutics. Objective: To determine whether enigmatic SARS-CoV-2 lineages detected in wastewater have a human or non-human (i.e., animal) source. Design: On January 11, 2022, an unusual Spike sequence was detected in municipal wastewater from a metropolitan area. Over the next four months, more focused wastewater sampling resolved the source of this variant. Setting: This study was performed in Wisconsin, United States, which has a comprehensive program for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater. Participants: Composite wastewater samples were used for this study; therefore, no individuals participated. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): The primary outcome was to determine the host(s) responsible for shedding this variant in wastewater. Both human and non-human hosts were plausible candidates at the study's outset. Results: The presence of the cryptic virus was narrowed from a municipal wastewater sample (catchment area >100,000 people) to an indoor wastewater sample from a single facility (catchment area ~30 people), indicating the human origin of this virus. Extraordinarily high concentrations of viral RNA (~520,000,000 genome copies / L and ~1,600,000,000 genome copies / L in June and August 2022, respectively) were detected in the indoor wastewater sample. The virus sequence harbored a combination of fixed nucleotide substitutions previously observed only in Pango lineage B.1.234, a variant that circulated at low levels in Wisconsin from October 2020 to February 2021.

Infection in humans results in a variety of outcomes ranging from asymptomatic cases to the disease COVID-19, which can have significant morbidity and mortality, with over two million confirmed deaths worldwide as of January 2021. Over a year into the pandemic, sequencing analysis has shown that variants of SARS-CoV-2 are being selected as the virus continues to circulate widely within the human population. The predominant drivers of genetic variation within SARS-CoV-2 are single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) caused by polymerase error, potential host factor driven RNA modification, and insertion/deletions (indels) resulting from the discontinuous nature of viral RNA synthesis. While many mutations represent neutral ‘genetic drift’ or have quickly died out, a subset may be affecting viral traits such as transmissibility, pathogenicity, host range, and antigenicity of the virus.

Standardized differences measured the effect size of the difference between Omicron and pre-Omicron cohorts. Results The study included 946 children with a diagnosis of MIS-C. The largest differences in the Omicron period compared to prior years were decreases in the percentage of children with abnormal troponin (effect size = 0.40), abnormal lymphocytes (effect size = 0.33), and intensive care unit (ICU) visits (effect size = 0.34). There were small decreases in the Omicron period for the majority of treatments and abnormal laboratory measurements examined, including infliximab, anticoagulants, furosemide, aspirin, IVIG without steroids, echocardiograms, mechanical ventilation, platelets, ferritin, and sodium. Conclusions This study provides the first evidence that the severity of MIS-C declined in the first half of the year 2022 relative to prior years of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.",,2022,secondary,doi:10.1101/2022.10.19.22281256,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2022.10.19.22281256,

However, phasing is limited by read length and stretches of homozygosity along the genome. To overcome this limitation, we designed MethPhaser, the first method that utilizes methylation signals from Oxford Nanopore Technologies to extend SNV-based phasing. Across control samples, we extend the phase length N50 by almost 3-fold while minimally increasing the phasing error by ∼0.02%. Nevertheless, methylation signals have limitations, such as random signals on sex chromosomes or tissue purity. To assess the latter, we also applied MethPhaser on blood samples from 4 patients, still showing improvements over SNV-only phasing. MethPhaser further improves phasing across HLA and multiple other medically relevant genes, improving our understanding of how mutations interact across multiple phenotypes.

doi:10.1039/d3nr02378h,Ultra-stable silver nanotriangles: efficient and versatile colorimetric reporters for dipstick assays.,"Noble metal anisotropic nanostructures, such as silver nanoplates (AgNPls), are interesting because they possess enhanced plasmonic properties compared to their spherical counterparts: increased extinction coefficient and tunable maximum of absorption wavelength. However, their use for biosensing application is limited as these structures are intrinsically unstable and, to maintain the anisotropic structure, a coating protecting the metallic surface is required. In this work, we report on the capacity of a thin but robust coating based on calixarene-diazonium salts to maintain the structure anisotropy of silver nanoplates in conditions in which traditionally used coatings fail. We synthesized AgNPls of various sizes and coated them with two different calixarenes, differing by the functional groups attached to their small rim. After characterization of the efficiency of the ligand exchange process between the initial citrate anions and the calixarenes, the chemical and colloidal stabilities of the resulting calixarene-coated AgNPls were compared to citrate-capped AgNPls. A radical improvement of the lifetime of the material from 1 day for AgNPls coated with citrate to more than 900 days for calixarene-coated AgNPls, as well as the stability in acidic conditions, phosphate saline buffer (PBS) or biofluid, were observed. Benefiting from this exceptional robustness, calixarene-coated AgNPls were exploited to design dipstick assays. Rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) detection was developed first as proof-of-concept. The optimal system was then used for the detection of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG. In both cases, a picomolar limit of detection (LOD) was achieved as well as the detection in 100% of pooled human plasma. This sensitivity competes with that of ELISA and is better than the one previously obtained with gold or even silver nanospheres for the same target and in similar conditions. Finally, the wide range of colors provided by the AgNPls allowed the design of a multicolor multiplex assay for the simultaneous detection of multiple analytes.",Nanoscale,2023,secondary,doi:10.1039/d3nr02378h,37401243,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1039/d3nr02378h,

doi:10.47102/annals-acadmedsg.v52n10p533,Cardiovascular effects of COVID-19 in children,"Introduction: Although severe acute respiratory failure is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, this viral infection leads to cardiovascular disease in some individuals. Cardiac effects of the virus include myocarditis, pericarditis, arrhythmias, coronary aneurysms and cardiomyopathy, and can result in cardiogenic shock and multisystem organ failure. 

Method: This review summarises cardiac manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 in the paediatric population. We performed a scoping review of cardiovascular disease associated with acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), and mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Also examined are special considerations for paediatric athletes and return to play following COVID-19 infection. 

Results: Children presenting with acute COVID-19 should be screened for cardiac dysfunction and a thorough history should be obtained. Further cardiovascular evaluation should be considered following any signs/symptoms of arrhythmias, low cardiac output, and/or myopericarditis. Patients admitted with severe acute COVID-19 should be monitored with continuous cardiac monitoring. Laboratory testing, as clinically indicated, includes tests for troponin and B-type natriuretic peptide or N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide. Echocardiography with strain evaluation and/or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging should be considered to evaluate diastolic and systolic dysfunction, coronary anatomy, the pericardium and the myocardium. For patients with MIS-C, combination therapy with intravenous immunoglobulin and glucocorticoid therapy is safe and potentially disease altering. Treatment of MIS-C targets the hyperimmune response. Supportive care, including mechanical support, is needed in some cases. 

Conclusion: Cardiovascular disease is a striking feature of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Most infants, children and adolescents with COVID-19 cardiac disease fully recover with no lasting cardiac dysfunction. However, long-term studies and further research are needed to assess cardiovascular risk with variants of SARS-CoV-2 and to understand the pathophysiology of cardiac dysfunction with COVID-19.","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",2023,secondary,doi:10.47102/annals-acadmedsg.v52n10p533,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.47102/annals-acadmedsg.v52n10p533,
doi:10.3390/pathogens12020329,The Role of Immunity in the Pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 Infection and in the Protection Generated by COVID-19 Vaccines in Different Age Groups,"This study aims to review the available data regarding the central role of immunity in combating SARS-CoV-2 infection and in the generation of protection by vaccination against COVID-19 in different age groups. Physiologically, the immune response and the components involved in it are variable, both functionally and quantitatively, in neonates, infants, children, adolescents, and adults. These immunological differences are mirrored during COVID-19 infection and in the post-vaccination period. The outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection is greatly dependent on the reaction orchestrated by the immune system. This is clearly obvious in relation to the clinical status of COVID-19 infection, which can be symptomless, mild, moderate, or severe. Even the complications of the disease show a proportional pattern in relation to the immune response. On the contrary, the commonly used anti-COVID-19 vaccines generate protective humoral and cellular immunity. The magnitude of this immunity and the components involved in it are discussed in detail. Furthermore, many of the adverse effects of these vaccines can be explained on the basis of immune reactions against the different components of the vaccines. Regarding the appropriate choice of vaccine for different age groups, many factors have to be considered. This is a cornerstone, particularly in the following age groups: 1 day to 5 years, 6 to 11 years, and 12 to 17 years. Many factors are involved in deciding the route, doses, and schedule of vaccination for children. Another important issue in this dilemma is the hesitancy of families in making the decision about whether to vaccinate their children. Added to these difficulties is the choice by health authorities and governments concerning whether to make children’s vaccination compulsory. In this respect, although rare and limited, adverse effects of vaccines in children have been detected, some of which, unfortunately, have been serious or even fatal. However, to achieve comprehensive control over COVID-19 in communities, both children and adults have to be vaccinated, as the former group represents a reservoir for viral transmission. The understanding of the various immunological mechanisms involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection and in the preparation and application of its vaccines has given the sciences a great opportunity to further deepen and expand immunological knowledge. This will hopefully be reflected positively on other diseases through gaining an immunological background that may aid in diagnosis and therapy. Humanity is still in continuous conflict with SARS-CoV-2 infection and will be for a while, but the future is expected to be in favor of the prevention and control of this disease.",Pathogens,2023,secondary,doi:10.3390/pathogens12020329,36839601,9967364,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/pathogens12020329,

The significance of the presence and infectivity of this virus on environmental surfaces, especially in a hospital setting, remains less clear. Objectives: We aimed to analyze surface swabs for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and infectivity, and to determine their suitability for sequence analysis. Methods: Samples were collected during two waves of COVID-19 at the University of California, Davis Medical Center, in COVID-19 patient serving and staff congregation areas. qRT-PCR positive samples were investigated in Vero cell cultures for cytopathic effects and phylogenetically assessed by whole genome sequencing. Measurements and Main Results: Improved cleaning and patient management practices between April and August 2020 were associated with a substantial reduction of SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR positivity (from 11% to 2%) in hospital surface samples. Even though we recovered near-complete genome sequences in some, none of the positive samples (11 of 224 total) caused cytopathic effects in cultured cells suggesting this nucleic acid was either not associated with intact virions, or they were present in insufficient numbers for infectivity. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 genomes of the positive samples were derived from hospitalized patients. Genomic sequences isolated from qRT-PCR negative samples indicate a superior sensitivity of viral detection by sequencing. Conclusions: This study confirms the low likelihood that SARS-CoV-2 contamination on hospital surfaces contains infectious virus, disputing the importance of fomites in COVID-19 transmission.

There were 12 antibodies targeting distinct epitopes on spike, including two sites on the RBD and one on the N-terminal domain (NTD), that displayed cross-neutralization of VOCs, for which distinct antibody targets could neutralize discrete variants. ABSTRACT Several severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants have arisen that exhibit increased viral transmissibility and partial evasion of immunity induced by natural infection and vaccination. To address the specific antibody targets that were affected by recent viral variants, we generated 43 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from 10 convalescent donors that bound three distinct domains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike. Viral variants harboring mutations at K417, E484, and N501 could escape most of the highly potent antibodies against the receptor binding domain (RBD). Despite this, we identified 12 neutralizing mAbs against three distinct regions of the spike protein that neutralize SARS-CoV-2 and variants of concern (VOCs), including B.1.1.7 (alpha), P.1 (gamma), and B.1.617.2 (delta). Notably, antibodies targeting distinct epitopes could neutralize discrete variants, suggesting that different variants may have evolved to disrupt the binding of particular neutralizing antibody classes. These results underscore that humans exposed to the first pandemic wave of prototype SARS-CoV-2 possess neutralizing antibodies against current variants and that it is critical to induce antibodies targeting multiple distinct epitopes of the spike that can neutralize emerging variants of concern. IMPORTANCE We describe the binding and neutralization properties of a new set of human monoclonal antibodies derived from memory B cells of 10 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescent donors in the first pandemic wave of prototype SARS-CoV-2. There were 12 antibodies targeting distinct epitopes on spike, including two sites on the RBD and one on the N-terminal domain (NTD), that displayed cross-neutralization of VOCs, for which distinct antibody targets could neutralize discrete variants. This work underlines that natural infection by SARS-CoV-2 induces effective cross-neutralization against only some VOCs and supports the need for COVID-19 vaccination for robust induction of neutralizing antibodies targeting multiple epitopes of the spike protein to combat the current SARS-CoV-2 VOCs and any others that might emerge in the future.",mBio,2021,secondary,doi:10.1128/mBio.02975-21,34781736,8593667,https://doi.org/doi:10.1128/mBio.02975-21,

User-defined thresholds allow for the retention or rejection of specific molecules, informed by the real-time reference mapping results, as they are physically passing through a given sequencing nanopore. We developed a metagenomics workflow for ultra-sensitive diagnosis of bacterial pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) from clinic samples, which is based on the efficient selective human host depletion NAS sequencing, real-time species identification and species-specific resistance gene prediction. Our method increased microbial sequence yield at least 8-fold in all 11 sequenced clinical Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid (BALF) samples (4.5h from sample to result), displayed 100% sensitivity and specificity for pathogen detection compared with cultivation method, and accurately detected antibiotic resistance genes at species level.",,2022,secondary,doi:10.1101/2022.07.03.22277093,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2022.07.03.22277093,
doi:10.1039/d2nr05868e,Uptake and stability of DNA nanostructures in cells: a cross-sectional overview of the current state of the art.,"The physical and chemical properties of synthetic DNA have transformed this prototypical biopolymer into a versatile nanoscale building block material in the form of DNA nanotechnology. DNA nanotechnology is, in turn, providing unprecedented precision bioengineering for numerous biomedical applications at the nanoscale including next generation immune-modulatory materials, vectors for targeted delivery of nucleic acids, drugs, and contrast agents, intelligent sensors for diagnostics, and theranostics, which combines several of these functionalities into a single construct. Assembling a DNA nanostructure to be programmed with a specific number of targeting moieties on its surface to imbue it with concomitant cellular uptake and retention capabilities along with carrying a specific therapeutic dose is now eminently feasible due to the extraordinary self-assembling properties and high formation efficiency of these materials. However, what remains still only partially addressed is how exactly this class of materials is taken up into cells in both the native state and as targeted or chemically facilitated, along with how stable they are inside the cellular cytosol and other cellular organelles. In this minireview, we summarize what is currently reported in the literature about how (i) DNA nanostructures are taken up into cells along with (ii) what is understood about their subsequent stability in the complex multi-organelle environment of the cellular milieu along with biological fluids in general. This allows us to highlight the many challenges that still remain to overcome in understanding DNA nanostructure-cellular interactions in order to fully translate these exciting new materials.",Nanoscale,2023,secondary,doi:10.1039/d2nr05868e,36722508,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1039/d2nr05868e,
doi:10.2196/35311,Risk Factors Associated With SARS-CoV-2 Breakthrough Infections in Fully mRNA-Vaccinated Individuals: Retrospective Analysis,"Background COVID-19 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines have demonstrated efficacy and effectiveness in preventing symptomatic COVID-19, while being relatively safe in trial studies. However, vaccine breakthrough infections have been reported. Objective This study aims to identify risk factors associated with COVID-19 breakthrough infections among fully mRNA-vaccinated individuals. Methods We conducted a series of observational retrospective analyses using the electronic health records (EHRs) of the Columbia University Irving Medical Center/New York Presbyterian (CUIMC/NYP) up to September 21, 2021. New York City (NYC) adult residences with at least 1 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) record were included in this analysis. Poisson regression was performed to assess the association between the breakthrough infection rate in vaccinated individuals and multiple risk factors—including vaccine brand, demographics, and underlying conditions—while adjusting for calendar month, prior number of visits, and observational days in the EHR. Results The overall estimated breakthrough infection rate was 0.16 (95% CI 0.14-0.18). Individuals who were vaccinated with Pfizer/BNT162b2 (incidence rate ratio [IRR] against Moderna/mRNA-1273=1.66, 95% CI 1.17-2.35) were male (IRR against female=1.47, 95% CI 1.11-1.94) and had compromised immune systems (IRR=1.48, 95% CI 1.09-2.00) were at the highest risk for breakthrough infections. Among all underlying conditions, those with primary immunodeficiency, a history of organ transplant, an active tumor, use of immunosuppressant medications, or Alzheimer disease were at the highest risk. Conclusions Although we found both mRNA vaccines were effective, Moderna/mRNA-1273 had a lower incidence rate of breakthrough infections. Immunocompromised and male individuals were among the highest risk groups experiencing breakthrough infections. Given the rapidly changing nature of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, continued monitoring and a generalizable analysis pipeline are warranted to inform quick updates on vaccine effectiveness in real time.",JMIR Public Health and Surveillance,2021,secondary,doi:10.2196/35311,35486806,9132195,https://doi.org/doi:10.2196/35311,

Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the sample is characterized by a gain of 89 mutations since divergence from its nearest sequenced neighbor, which had been collected in September 2020 and belongs to the B.1.1 lineage, largely extinct in 2022. 33 of these mutations were coding and occurred in the Spike protein. Of these, 17 are lineage-defining in some of the variants of concern (VOCs) or are in sites where another mutation is lineage-defining in a variant of concern, and/or shown to be involved in antibody evasion, and/or detected in other cases of persistent COVID-19; these include some ""usual suspects,"" such as Spike:L452R, E484Q, K417T, Y453F, and N460K. Molecular clock analysis indicates that mutations in this lineage accumulated at an increased rate compared to the ancestral B.1.1 strain. This increase is driven by the accumulation of nonsynonymous mutations, for an average dN/dS value of 2.2, indicating strong positive selection during within-patient evolution. Additionally, there is reason to believe that the virus had persisted for at least some time in the gastrointestinal tract, as evidenced by the presence of mutations that are rare in the general population samples but common in samples from wastewater. Our analysis adds to the growing body of research on evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in chronically infected patients and its relationship to the emergence of variants of concern.",,2023,secondary,doi:10.1101/2023.09.14.23295379,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2023.09.14.23295379,

Work to date has been limited to monitoring a single pathogen or small numbers of pathogens in targeted studies; however, simultaneous analysis of a wide variety of pathogens would greatly increase the utility of wastewater surveillance. We developed a novel quantitative multi-pathogen surveillance approach (33 pathogen targets including bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and helminths) using TaqMan Array Cards (RT-qPCR) and applied the method on concentrated wastewater samples collected at four wastewater treatment plants in Atlanta, GA from February to October of 2020. From sewersheds serving approximately 2 million people, we detected a wide range of targets including many we expected to find in wastewater (e.g., enterotoxigenic E. coli and Giardia in 97% of 29 samples at stable concentrations) as well as unexpected targets including Strongyloides stercolaris (i.e., human threadworm, a neglected tropical disease rarely observed in clinical settings in the USA). Other notable detections included SARS-CoV-2, but also several pathogen targets that are not commonly included in wastewater surveillance like Acanthamoeba spp., Balantidium coli, Entamoeba histolytica, astrovirus, norovirus, and sapovirus. Our data suggest broad utility in expanding the scope of enteric pathogen surveillance in wastewaters, with potential for application in a variety of settings where pathogen quantification in fecal waste streams can inform public health surveillance and selection of control measures to limit infections.",medRxiv,2023,secondary,doi:10.1101/2023.06.23.23291792,37425908,10327253,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2023.06.23.23291792,

Conductive hydrogels hold great promise as sensing materials for the new‐generation touch panel. However, most hydrogel‐based touch panels are developed based on single‐function gel materials with a lack of the anti‐freezing and self‐power capabilities. Herein, the authors demonstrate a multi‐functional surface‐capacitive touch panel based on a triboelectric nanogenerator with an instantaneous peak power density of 209 mW m−2 that uses zwitterionic network hydrogels as a highly transparent (98.1% transmittance), ultra‐stretchable (>11 500% strain), degradable, and flexible ionic conductor. The panel can be utilized as a human‐machine interactive interface with fast response, high resolution, low parasitic capacitance, functional recovery instantly upon damage, and without sacrificing its functionalities even in the high stretch state (1600% areal strain) and at the subzero environment (<−20 °C). Epidermal touch panels are operated on arbitrary and complex surfaces, with outstanding input property demonstrated by writing, and playing computer games.

The manifestation of the disease can vary from being asymptomatic to severe life-threatening conditions warranting hospitalization and ventilation support. Furthermore, the emergence of mutecated variants of concern (VOCs) is paramount to the devastating effect of the pandemic. This highly contagious virus and its emergent variants challenge the available advanced viral diagnostic methods for high-accuracy testing with faster result yields. This review is to shed light on the natural history, pathology, molecular biology, and efficient diagnostic methods of COVID-19, detecting SARS-CoV-2 in collected samples.

Yet the analysis of viromes in wastewater has been widely applied for several decades in conjunction with traditional chemical analysis approaches. However, even though real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) based molecular detection methods are now mainstream in large and small labs alike, wastewater sampling and nucleic acid extraction procedures are not yet standardized or optimized to enable routine and robust analysis and results interpretation. Here, we employ a flotation-based nucleic acid extraction method using microbubbles that allows for simple direct collection and lysis of total wastewater samples without the requirement for pasteurization or filtration of solid components prior to analysis. An additional advantage discovered during testing was reduced sample input needs while maintaining sensitivity compared to precipitation and ultrafiltration-based methods.

These were compared with comparable published v-beta TCR sequences from people diagnosed with KD and from healthy individuals. Since TCR V-beta sequences are supposed to be complementary to antigens that induce clonal expansion, it was surprising that only a quarter of the TCR sequences derived from severe COVID-19 and MIS-C patients mimicked SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Thirty percent of the KD-derived TCR mimicked coronaviruses other than SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, only three percent of the TCR sequences from healthy individuals and those diagnosed with autoimmune myocarditis displayed similarities to any coronavirus. In each disease, significant increases were found in the amount of TCRs from healthy individuals mimicking specific bacterial co-infections (especially Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcal and Streptococcal antigens) and host autoantigens targeted by autoimmune diseases (especially myosin, collagen, phospholipid-associated proteins, and blood coagulation proteins).

Maternal SARS-CoV-2 may potentially cause a similar hyperinflammatory syndrome in neonates due to transplacental transfer of antibodies. We reviewed the perinatal history, clinical features, and outcomes of 20 neonates with features consistent with MIS-C related to maternal SARS-CoV-2 in Kolhapur, India, from 1 September 2020 to 30 April 2021. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies were tested in all neonates. Fifteen singletons and five twins born to eighteen mothers with a history of COVID-19 disease or exposure during pregnancy presented with features consistent with MIS-C during the first 5 days after birth. Nineteen were positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and all were negative for IgM antibodies. All mothers were asymptomatic and therefore not tested by RTPCR-SARS-CoV-2 at delivery. Eighteen neonates (90%) had cardiac involvement with prolonged QTc, 2:1 AV block, cardiogenic shock, or coronary dilatation. Other findings included respiratory failure (40%), fever (10%), feeding intolerance (30%), melena (10%), and renal failure (5%). All infants had elevated inflammatory biomarkers and received steroids and IVIG. Two infants died.

Despite that, there have been over 767 million reported cases and over 6.9 million deaths worldwide. Therefore, tunable, sensitive, and high-throughput assays are warranted to control future outbreaks. Herein, we developed a tunable in situ assay to selectively sort virions and infected host-derived extracellular vesicles (IHD-EVs) and simultaneously detect their antigens and nucleic acid cargo at a single-particle resolution. The Biochip Antigen and RNA Assay (BARATM) integrates positive immunoselection and infection dynamics to sort particles, immunofluorescence to detect antigens, and fluorescence in situ hybridization to detect nucleic acids. BARATM enhanced sensitivities by detecting biomolecular signatures at the single-particle level, enabling the detection of virions in asymptomatic patients, and genetic mutations in single SARS-CoV-2 virions. Furthermore, BARATM revealed the continued long-term expression of virion-RNA in the IHD-EVs of post-acute sequelae SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) patients. BARATM was validated on saliva (30 healthy donors and 33 symptomatic and 20 asymptomatic patients) and nasopharyngeal swabs (19 healthy donors and 40 patients), revealing a highly accurate diagnosis by simultaneously detecting the spike glycoprotein and nucleocapsid-encoding RNA on single SARS-CoV-2 virions with sensitivities of 100 % and 95 %, respectively, and specificities of 100 % for both biofluids.

Whether all, or some, persist after 6 months, and their correlation with sustained anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity, is still controversial. Herein, we measured antibodies to multiple SARS-CoV-2 antigens (Wuhan-Hu-1 nucleoprotein (NP), whole spike (S), spike subunits (S1, S2 and receptor binding domain (RBD)) and Omicron spike) and 102 human proteins with known autoimmune associations, in plasma from healthcare workers 8 months post-exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (n=31 with confirmed COVID-19 disease and n=21 uninfected controls (PCR and anti-SARS-CoV-2 negative) at baseline). IgG antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 antigens were significantly higher in the convalescent cohort than the healthy cohort, highlighting lasting antibody responses up to 8 months post-infection. These were also shown to be cross-reactive to the Omicron variant spike protein at a similar level to lasting anti-RBD antibodies (correlation r=0.89). Individuals post COVID-19 infection recognised a common set of autoantigens, specific to this group in comparison to the healthy controls. Moreover, the long-term level of anti-Spike IgG was associated with the breadth of autoreactivity post-COVID-19. There were further moderate positive correlations between anti-SARS-CoV-2 responses and 11 specific autoantigens. The most commonly recognised autoantigens were found in the COVID-19 convalescent cohort. Although there was no overall correlation in self-reported symptom severity and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels, anti-calprotectin antibodies were associated with return to healthy normal life 8 months post infection. Calprotectin was also the most common target for autoantibodies, recognized by 22.6% of the overall convalescent cohort.

Antigen pool testing can increase the test rate and shorten the screening time, thus being a valuable approach for epidemic prevention and control. However, the overall percent agreement (OPA) with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is one-half to three-quarters, hampering it from being a comprehensive method, especially pool testing, beyond the gold-standard PCR. Here, a multiantibodies transistor assay is developed for sensitive and highly precise antigen pool testing. The multiantibodies capture SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 proteins with different configurations, resulting in an antigen-binding affinity down to 0.34 fM. The limit of detection reaches 3.5 × 10-17 g mL-1SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 protein in artificial saliva, 4-5 orders of magnitude lower than existing transistor sensors. The testing of 60 nasopharyngeal swabs exhibits ∼100% OPA with PCR within an average diagnoses time of 38.9 s. Owing to its highly precise feature, a portable integrated platform is fabricated, which achieves 10-in-1 pooled screening for high testing throughput.

A total of 2,624 wastewater samples (41 weeks) were collected weekly during May 2021- April 2022 from 64 wastewater facilities across Missouri, U.S. Three wastewater biomarkers, caffeine and its metabolite, paraxanthine, and pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV), were compared for the population normalization effectiveness for wastewater SARS-CoV-2 surveillance. Paraxanthine had the lowest temporal variation and strongest relationship between population compared to caffeine and PMMoV. This result was confirmed by data from ten different Wisconsin WWTPs with gradients in population sizes, indicating paraxanthine is a promising biomarker of the real-time population across a large geographical region. The estimated real-time population was directly compared against the population patterns with human movement mobility data. Of the three biomarkers, population normalization by paraxanthine significantly strengthened the relationship between wastewater SARS-CoV-2 viral load and COVID-19 incidence rate the most (40 out of 61 sewersheds). Caffeine could be a promising population biomarker for regions where no significant exogenous caffeine sources (e.g., discharges from food industries) exist. In contrast, PMMoV showed the highest variability over time, and therefore reduced the strength of the relationship between sewage SARS-CoV-2 viral load and the COVID-19 incidence rate, as compared to wastewater data without population normalization and the population normalized by either recent Census population or the population estimated based on the number of residential connections and average household size for that municipality from the Census.

Studies have indicated that ncRNAs are associated with the occurrence and development of KD. Thus, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the diagnostic value of ncRNAs in KD patients. Methods: We searched the PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, VIP, China Biology Medicine disc databases, and Wanfang databases until August 25, 2023 and screened all eligible studies focusing on the diagnostic performance of ncRNAs in KD patients. Results: In total, 535 articles were found, and 28 articles were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The calculated area under the curve value was 0.880 (95% confidence intervals, 0.840–0.900). The pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio were 0.790, 0.830, 4.610, and 0.260, respectively. The pooled diagnostic odds ratio was 17.890 (95% confidence intervals, 13.110–24.420), indicating a relatively good diagnostic performance of the ncRNAs for detecting KD. In addition, the diagnostic value of micro RNAs in KD was better than that of long noncoding RNAs and circular noncoding RNAs. A subgroup analysis by specimen indicated a better diagnostic value of ncRNAs in plasma and platelet than serum. The diagnostic accuracy of ncRNAs was better in febrile controls than in healthy control groups, indicating a relatively good accuracy in distinguishing KD patients from febrile diseases. Conclusions: This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated that ncRNAs could be used as novel biomarkers for detecting KD. More studies should be conducted in the future to verify the diagnostic values of ncRNAs in KD.",Medicine,2023,secondary,doi:10.1097/MD.0000000000035736,37960719,10637536,https://doi.org/doi:10.1097/MD.0000000000035736,

Here, we introduce the GeoMX Whole Transcriptome Atlas (WTA), a new technology for transcriptome-wide spatial profiling of tissues with cellular resolution. WTA significantly expands the Digital Spatial Profiling approach to enable in situ hybridisation against 18,190 genes at high-throughput using a sequencing readout. We applied WTA to generate the first spatial transcriptomic map of the fetal human neocortex, validating transcriptome-wide spatial profiling on formalin-fixed tissue material and demonstrating the spatial enrichment of autism gene expression in deep cortical layers. To demonstrate the value of WTA for cell atlasing, we integrated single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and WTA data to spatially map dozens of neural cell types and showed that WTA can be used to directly measure cell type specific transcriptomes in situ. Moreover, we developed computational tools for background correction of WTA data and accurate integration with scRNA-seq.

doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1010951,"Deep mutational scans for ACE2 binding, RBD expression, and antibody escape in the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 receptor-binding domains","SARS-CoV-2 continues to acquire mutations in the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) that impact ACE2 receptor binding, folding stability, and antibody recognition. Deep mutational scanning prospectively characterizes the impacts of mutations on these biochemical properties, enabling rapid assessment of new mutations seen during viral surveillance. However, the effects of mutations can change as the virus evolves, requiring updated deep mutational scans. We determined the impacts of all amino acid mutations in the Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 RBDs on ACE2-binding affinity, RBD folding, and escape from binding by the LY-CoV1404 (bebtelovimab) monoclonal antibody. The effects of some mutations in Omicron RBDs differ from those measured in the ancestral Wuhan-Hu-1 background. These epistatic shifts largely resemble those previously seen in the Beta variant due to the convergent epistatically modifying N501Y substitution. However, Omicron variants show additional lineage-specific shifts, including examples of the epistatic phenomenon of entrenchment that causes the Q498R and N501Y substitutions present in Omicron to be more favorable in that background than in earlier viral strains. In contrast, the Omicron substitution Q493R exhibits no sign of entrenchment, with the derived state, R493, being as unfavorable for ACE2 binding in Omicron RBDs as in Wuhan-Hu-1. Likely for this reason, the R493Q reversion has occurred in Omicron sub-variants including BA.4/BA.5 and BA.2.75, where the affinity buffer from R493Q reversion may potentiate concurrent antigenic change. Consistent with prior studies, we find that Omicron RBDs have reduced expression, and identify candidate stabilizing mutations that ameliorate this deficit. Last, our maps highlight a broadening of the sites of escape from LY-CoV1404 antibody binding in BA.1 and BA.2 compared to the ancestral Wuhan-Hu-1 background. These BA.1 and BA.2 deep mutational scanning datasets identify shifts in the RBD mutational landscape and inform ongoing efforts in viral surveillance. Author Summary SARS-CoV-2 evolves in part through mutations in its spike receptor-binding domain. As these mutations accumulate in evolved variants, they shape the future evolutionary potential of the virus through the phenomenon of epistasis. We characterized the functional impacts of mutations in the Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 receptor-binding domains on ACE2 receptor binding, protein folding, and recognition by the clinical LY-CoV1404 antibody. We then compared the measurements to prior data for earlier variants. These comparisons identify patterns of epistasis that may alter future patterns of Omicron evolution, such as turnover in the availability of specific affinity-enhancing mutations and an expansion in the number of paths of antibody escape from a key monoclonal antibody used for therapeutic treatment of COVID-19.

To date, most data on SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity has come from the sequencing of clinical samples, but such studies may suffer limitations due to costs and throughput. Wastewater-based epidemiology may provide an alternative and complementary approach for monitoring communities for novel variants. Given that SARS-CoV-2 can infect the cells of the human gut and is found in high concentrations in feces, wastewater may be a valuable source of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, which can be deep sequenced to provide information on the circulating variants in a community. Here we describe a safe, affordable protocol for the sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using high-throughput Illumina sequencing technology. Our targeted sequencing approach revealed the presence of mutations associated with several Variants of Concern at appreciable frequencies. Our work demonstrates that wastewater-based SARS-CoV-2 sequencing can inform surveillance efforts monitoring the community spread of SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern and detect the appearance of novel emerging variants more cheaply, safely, and efficiently than the sequencing of individual clinical samples.",,2021,secondary,doi:10.1101/2021.03.21.21253978,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2021.03.21.21253978,

However, currently developed concrete corrosion protection strategies have limitations in wide applications. Here, a biomineralization method was proposed to form a biomineralized film on concrete surfaces for corrosion inhibition. Laboratory seawater corrosion experiments were conducted under different conditions [e.g., chemical corrosion (CC), MIC, and biomineralization for corrosion inhibition]. A combination of chemical and mechanical property measurements of concrete (e.g., sulfate concentrations, permeability, mass, and strength) and a genotypic-based investigation of formed concrete biofilms was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the biomineralization approach on corrosion inhibition. The results show that MIC resulted in much higher corrosion rates than CC. However, the biomineralization treatment effectively inhibited corrosion because the biomineralized film decreased the total and relative abundance of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and acted as a protective layer to control the diffusion of sulfate and isolate the concrete from the corrosive SRB communities, which helps extend the lifespan of concrete structures. Moreover, this technique had no negative impact on the native marine microbial communities.

To assess the prevalence of residual cardiovascular pathology by cardiac MRI (CMR), ambulatory rhythm monitoring, and cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) in patients ∼6 months after multisystem inflammatory disease in children (MIS-C).


METHODS
Patients seen for MIS-C follow-up were referred for CMR, ambulatory rhythm monitoring, and CPET ∼6 months after illness. Patients were included if they had ≥1 follow-up study performed by the time of data collection. MIS-C was diagnosed on the basis of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria. Myocardial injury during acute illness was defined as serum Troponin-I level >0.05 ng/mL or diminished left ventricular systolic function on echocardiogram.


RESULTS
Sixty-nine of 153 patients seen for MIS-C follow-up had ≥1 follow-up cardiac study between October 2020-June 2022. Thirty-seven (54%) had evidence of myocardial injury during acute illness. Of these, 12 of 26 (46%) had ≥1 abnormality on CMR, 4 of 33 (12%) had abnormal ambulatory rhythm monitor results, and 18 of 22 (82%) had reduced functional capacity on CPET. Of the 37 patients without apparent myocardial injury, 11 of 21 (52%) had ≥1 abnormality on CMR, 1 of 24 (4%) had an abnormal ambulatory rhythm monitor result, and 11 of 15 (73%) had reduced functional capacity on CPET. The prevalence of abnormal findings was not statistically significantly different between groups.


CONCLUSIONS
The high prevalence of abnormal findings on follow-up cardiac studies and lack of significant difference between patients with and without apparent myocardial injury during hospitalization suggests that all patients treated for MIS-C warrant cardiology follow-up.",Pediatrics,2023,secondary,doi:10.1542/peds.2023-063002,37964674,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1542/peds.2023-063002,

Some unexpected adverse effects such as the development of systemic hyper inflammation with multiorgan involvement after vaccination, in rare cases, have been reported. However, its pathogenesis remains unclear. Methods: This study recruited two cases who suffered from systemic inflammation following ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine and two 30-year-old male volunteers without underlying disease who have received ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine as control group. Blood samples were collected from our patients and healthy subjects before and after treatment with anti-inflammatory agent such as glucocorticoid and tocilizumab. The immune profile from our patients and healthy controls were measured using a human XL cytokine Proteome Profiler array (ARY022b, R&D Systems). Results: Biochemical parameters revealed leukocytosis with segmented neutrophil dominance and elevated serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and ferritin in these two patients. The cytokine array revealed that mean levels of T cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 (TIM-3) (3640.3 vs 1580.5 pixels per inch [ppi]), B-cell activating factor (BAFF) (3036.8 vs 1471.0 ppi), urokinase plasminogen activator surface receptor (uPAR) (1043.1 vs 516.8 ppi), Resistin (1783.7 vs 711.3 ppi), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-AB/BB (1980.7 vs 939.7 ppi), macrophage inflammatory protein-3-beta (MIP-3β) (911.9 vs 346.2 ppi), and interferon-inducible T-cell alpha chemoattractant (I-TAC) (1026.3 vs 419.7 ppi) were 2-fold higher in the patients than in normal subjects who received ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine.

As nitric oxide (NO) is involved in many respiratory system processes and functions, we aimed to determine if expired nitric oxide (FENO) levels can provide an indication of PO2tox susceptibility in humans. Eight U.S. Navy-trained divers volunteered as subjects. The hyperoxic exposures consisted of six- and eight-hour hyperbaric chamber dives conducted on consecutive days in which subjects breathed 100% oxygen at 202.65 kPa. Subjects’ individual variability in pulmonary function and FENO was measured twice daily over five days and compared with their post-dive values to assess susceptibility to PO2tox. Only subjects who showed no decrements in pulmonary function following the six-hour exposure conducted the eight-hour dive. FENO decreased by 55% immediately following the six-hour oxygen exposure (n = 8, p < 0.0001) and by 63% following the eight-hour exposure (n = 4, p < 0.0001). Four subjects showed significant decreases in pulmonary function immediately following the six-hour exposure. These subjects had the lowest baseline FENO, had the lowest post-dive FENO, and had clinical symptoms of PO2tox.

We propose a differentiated pooling strategy that independently optimizes pool sizes for distinct groups with different probabilities of infection to further improve the efficiency of pooled testing. We compare the efficiency (results obtained per test kit used) of the differentiated strategy to a traditional pooling strategy in which all samples are processed using uniform pool sizes under a range of scenarios. For most scenarios, differentiated pooling is more efficient than traditional pooling. In scenarios examined here, an improvement in efficiency of up to 3.94 results per test kit could be obtained through differentiated versus traditional pooling, with more likely scenarios resulting in 0.12 to 0.61 additional results per kit. Under circumstances similar to those observed in a university setting, implementation of our strategy could result in an improvement in efficiency between 0.03 to 3.21 results per test kit. Our results can help identify settings, such as universities and workplaces, where differentiated pooling can conserve critical testing resources.",American Journal of Epidemiology,2022,secondary,doi:10.1093/aje/kwac178,36222677,9620733,https://doi.org/doi:10.1093/aje/kwac178,

Multiple genetic approaches have been carried out, primarily in adults with extrapolation to children, including genome-wide association studies (GWAS), whole exome and whole genome sequencing (WES/WGS), and target gene analyses. Recent findings Data from adults with severe COVID-19 have identified genomic regions (human leukocyte antigen locus and 3p21.31) as potential risk factors. Genes related to viral entry into cells (ABO blood group locus, ACE2, TMPRS22) have been linked to severe COVID-19 patients by GWAS and target gene approaches. Type I interferon (e.g. IFNAR2) and antiviral gene (e.g. TLR7) associations have been identified by several genetic approaches in severe COVID-19. WES has noted associations with several immune regulatory genes (e.g. SOCS1). Target gene approaches have identified mutations in perforin-mediated cytolytic pathway genes in children and adults with severe COVID-19 and children with MIS-C. Summary Several genetic associations have been identified in individuals with severe COVID-19 and MIS-C via various genetic approaches.

The responses of nursing teams to large-scale COVID-19 screening have rarely been addressed or described. The aim of this study is to introduce an efficient response strategy for nurses in large-scale COVID-19 screening. A new COVID-19 case was confirmed on Jan 14, 2021 in Nanning, China. Immediately, a large-scale COVID-19 screening was launched and ran from Jan 14 to Jan 17, 2021. Our nurse team responding to the screening included three major components: (1) establishing a leadership group and a nucleic acid sampling emergency team; (2) defining, conducting, and evaluating nurse training; (3) implementing efficient sampling schemes (10 in 1 mixed sample technique). A total of 500 nurse volunteers were recruited and divided into three echelons. A total of 353 trained nurses were sent to 65 sampling stand stations. In cooperation with nurses from other health institutions, samples were collected from a total of 854,215 people in only 4 days for 2019-nCOV nucleic acid screening.

Infants with KD are at higher risk of severe clinical presentation, therapy failure, complications and coronary aneurysms (CAAs), and this is the reason they deserve more aggressive therapy and a strict clinical follow-up. We report a 2-month-old male with KD, complicated by Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS). Despite timely and aggressive therapy with immunoglobulins, steroids and aspirin, multiple CAAs developed. Two-month therapy with anakinra completely reverted all the aneurysms. After six months, the infant experienced KD relapse and was successfully re-treated with immunoglobulins, steroids and aspirin. A strict echocardiographic follow-up did not show recurrence of aneurysms. Two years later, the child is healthy, without cardiac sequelae. In our experience, anakinra was effective in reverting multiple aneurysms and its effect proved to be long-lasting, even in front of KD recurrence. Based on this evidence, it seems reasonable to hypothesize not to limit the use of anakinra as rescue therapy for complicated or refractory KD, but to consider the possibility of adding it to first-line therapies for some subgroups of very-high-risk patients, in order to strengthen the prevention of CAAs.",Children,2022,secondary,doi:10.3390/children9050672,35626849,9139195,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/children9050672,

doi:10.3389/fenvs.2023.1104679,A sustainable trend in COVID-19 research: An environmental perspective,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread across the globe producing hundreds of thousands of deaths, shutting down economies, closing borders and causing havoc on an unprecedented scale. Its potent effects have earned the attention of researchers in different fields worldwide. Among them, authors from different countries have published numerous research articles based on the environmental concepts of COVID-19. The environment is considered an essential receptor in the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is academically significant to look into publications to follow the pathway of hot topics of research and upcoming trends in studies. Reviewing the literature can therefore provide valuable information regarding the strengths and weaknesses in facing the COVID-19 pandemic, considering the environmental viewpoint. The present study categorizes the understanding caused by environmental and COVID-19-related published papers in the Scopus metadata from 2020 to 2021. VOSviewer is a promising bibliometric tool used to analyze the publications with keywords “COVID-19*” and “Environment.” Then, a narrative evaluation is utilized to delineate the most interesting research topics. Co-occurrence analysis is applied in this research, which further characterizes different thematic clusters. The published literature mainly focused on four central cluster environmental concepts: air pollution, epidemiology and virus transmission, water and wastewater, and environmental policy. It also reveals that environmental policy has gained worldwide interest, with the main keyword “management” and includes keywords like waste management, sustainability, governance, ecosystem, and climate change. Although these keywords could also appear in other environmental policy-related research studies, the importance of the COVID-19 pandemic requires such comprehensive research. The fourth cluster involves governance and management concerns encountered during the pandemic. Mapping the research topics in different clusters will pave the way for researchers to view future potential ideas and studies better. The scope for further research needs from the perspective of environmental concepts is reviewed and recommended, which can expand the vital role and value of environmental sciences in alerting, observing, and COVID-19 prediction for all four clusters. In other words, the research trend would shift from qualitative studies and perspectives to quantitative ones.",,2023,secondary,doi:10.3389/fenvs.2023.1104679,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.3389/fenvs.2023.1104679,

doi:10.12688/f1000research.131522.1,Seasonal effects decouple SARS-CoV-2 haplotypes worldwide,"Background: Variants of concern (VOCs) have been replacing each other during the still rampant COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, SARS-CoV-2 populations have evolved increasingly intricate constellations of mutations that often enhance transmissibility, disease severity, and other epidemiological characteristics. The origin and evolution of these constellations remain puzzling. Methods: Here we study the evolution of VOCs at the proteome level by analyzing about 12 million genomic sequences retrieved from GISAID on July 23, 2022. A total 183,276 mutations were identified and filtered with a relevancy heuristic. The prevalence of haplotypes and free-standing mutations was then tracked monthly in various latitude corridors of the world. Results: A chronology of 22 haplotypes defined three phases driven by protein flexibility-rigidity, environmental sensing, and immune escape. A network of haplotypes illustrated the recruitment and coalescence of mutations into major VOC constellations and seasonal effects of decoupling and loss. Protein interaction networks mediated by haplotypes predicted communications impacting the structure and function of proteins, showing the increasingly central role of molecular interactions involving the spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), and membrane (M) proteins. Haplotype markers either affected fusogenic regions while spreading along the sequence of the S-protein or clustered around binding domains. Modeling of protein structure with AlphaFold2 showed that VOC Omicron and one of its haplotypes were major contributors to the distortion of the M-protein endodomain, which behaves as a receptor of other structural proteins during virion assembly. Remarkably, VOC constellations acted cooperatively to balance the more extreme effects of individual haplotypes. Conclusions: Our study uncovers seasonal patterns of emergence and diversification occurring amid a highly dynamic evolutionary landscape of bursts and waves. The mapping of genetically-linked mutations to structures that sense environmental change with powerful ab initio modeling tools demonstrates the potential of deep-learning for COVID-19 predictive intelligence and therapeutic intervention.",F1000Research,2023,secondary,doi:10.12688/f1000research.131522.1,37069849,10105261,https://doi.org/doi:10.12688/f1000research.131522.1,

As such, a number of different pathways and networks may be modulated as a result. In fact, miRNAs are known to regulate many cellular processes including differentiation, proliferation, inflammation, and metabolism. This review focuses on the miR‐181 family and provides information from the published literature on the role of miR‐181 homologs in regulating a range of activities in different cell types and tissues. Of note, we have not included details on miR‐181 expression and function in the context of cancer since this is a broad topic area requiring independent review. Instead, we have focused on describing the function and mechanism of miR‐181 family members on differentiation toward a number of cell lineages in various non‐neoplastic conditions (e.g., immune/hematopoietic cells, osteoblasts, osteoclasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes). We have also provided information on how modulation of miR‐181 homologs can have positive effects on disease states such as cardiac abnormalities, pulmonary arterial hypertension, thrombosis, osteoarthritis, and vascular inflammation. In this context, we have used some examples of FDA‐approved drugs that modulate miR‐181 expression. We conclude by discussing some common mechanisms by which miR‐181 homologs appear to regulate a number of different cellular processes and how targeting specific miR‐181 family members may lead to attractive therapeutic approaches to treat a number of human disease or repair conditions, including those associated with the aging process.",Journal of Cellular Physiology,2023,secondary,doi:10.1002/jcp.30969,36780342,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1002/jcp.30969,

Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is one of the most severe clinical courses of COVID-19 and is suggested to be a hyperinflammatory condition. This study aimed to compare quantitative antibody levels against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in children with COVID-19 and MIS-C. Blood samples from 75 patients [n = 36 (48%) with mild/asymptomatic (group 1), n = 22 (29.3%) with moderate-to-severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (group 2) and n = 17 (22.6%) patients with MIS-C (group 3)] were analyzed 3 months after COVID-19. The majority of the children with asymptomatic/mild COVID-19 symptoms (80.6%), moderate/severe disease (90.9%), and MIS-C (82.4%) had detectable IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (p = 0.567). The mean antibody value against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was 321.9 ± 411.6 in group 1, 274 ± 261 in group 2, and 220 ± 299 in group 3, respectively (p > 0.05). Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 (asymptomatic/mild+moderate/severe) and those with MIS-C were also compared; the antibody positivity rates [COVID-19 group: 85.5%, MIS-C group: 82.4%, (p = 0.833)] and mean antibody values [COVID-19 group: 303.9 ± 360.3, MIS-C group: 220 ± 299, (p > 0.05)] were similar in both groups. In conclusion, the majority of children with COVID-19 and MIS-C developed a detectable antibody level against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein 3 months after COVID-19. Quantitative antibody levels were similar in both asymptomatic/mild disease, moderate/severe disease, and MIS-C group.

SARS-CoV-2 has caused over 3.5 million deaths since late 2019. Mutations in the spike (S) glycoprotein are of particular concern because it harbours the domain which recognises the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and is the target for neutralising antibodies. Mutations in the S protein may induce alterations in the surface spike structures, changing the conformational B-cell epitopes and leading to a potential reduction in vaccine efficacy. Here, we summarise how the more important variants of SARS-CoV-2, which include cluster 5, lineages B.1.1.7 (Alpha variant), B.1.351 (Beta), P.1 (B.1.1.28/Gamma), B.1.427/B.1.429 (Epsilon), B.1.526 (Iota) and B.1.617.2 (Delta) confer mutations in their respective spike proteins which enhance viral fitness by improving binding affinity to the ACE2 receptor and lead to an increase in infectivity and transmission.

Therefore, in this study, the indoor airborne bacterial microbiotas between commercial buildings, residences, and subways within the same city were compared using both OTU- and ASV-based analytic methods. Our findings suggested that indoor airborne bacterial microbiota compositions were significantly different between building types regardless of the bioinformatics method used. The processes of ecological drift and random dispersal consistently played significant roles in the assembly of the indoor microbiota across building types. Abundant taxa tended to be more centralized in the correlation network of each building type, highlighting their importance.

The aim of our study was to analyze the changes of cellular and humoral immune responses in children with MIS-C, depending on the severity of the disease. Methods: Clinical, hematological and immunological parameters in children with severe and extremely severe MIS-C were compared. The study included a total of 50 patients divided into 3 groups: 20 children with extremely severe MIS-C requiring ICU care (MIS-C ICU “+”); 15 children with severe MIS-C but not requiring ICU care (MIS-C ICU “-”); and a control group of 15 children who had previously had COVID-19 and didn’t have MIS-C (MIS-C “-”). Results: In patients with MIS-C requiring ICU care, heart and liver damage, hematological changes, and the development of severe complications such as edematous syndrome, polyserositis, DIC, and cardiogenic shock were statistically more common. Both groups of children with MIS-C had CD3+ T-cell lymphopenia and a decrease in CD95 expression. In the group of children with MIS-C requiring ICU care, a significant increase in the relative numbers of B-lymphocytes, CD3-HLA-DR+ and CD25 and a decrease of NK-cells was observed.

doi:10.1093/gbe/evad052,Nonsystematic Reporting Biases of the SARS-CoV-2 Variant Mu Could Impact Our Understanding of the Epidemiological Dynamics of Emerging Variants,"Abstract Developing a timely and effective response to emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) is of paramount public health importance. Global health surveillance does not rely on genomic data alone to identify concerning variants when they emerge. Instead, methods that utilize genomic data to estimate the epidemiological dynamics of emerging lineages have the potential to serve as an early warning system. However, these methods assume that genomic data are uniformly reported across circulating lineages. In this study, we analyze differences in reporting delays among SARS-CoV-2 VOCs as a plausible explanation for the timing of the global response to the former VOC Mu. Mu likely emerged in South America in mid-2020, where its circulation was largely confined. In this study, we demonstrate that Mu was designated as a VOC ∼1 year after it emerged and find that the reporting of genomic data for Mu differed significantly than that of other VOCs within countries, states, and individual laboratories. Our findings suggest that nonsystematic biases in the reporting of genomic data may have delayed the global response to Mu. Until they are resolved, the surveillance gaps that affected the global response to Mu could impede the rapid and accurate assessment of future emerging variants.",Genome Biology and Evolution,2023,secondary,doi:10.1093/gbe/evad052,36974986,10113931,https://doi.org/doi:10.1093/gbe/evad052,

We aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on post-COVID-19 chemosensory sensitivity in a group of young convalescents of eastern/central European ancestry. We measured subjects’ smell and taste capabilities with a standard testing kit, Monell Flavor Quiz (MFQ), and collected surveys on COVID-19 history. During testing, subjects rated liking and intensity of six odor samples (galaxolide, guaiacol, beta-ionone, trimethylamine, phenylethyl alcohol, 2-ethyl fenchol) and six taste samples (sucralose, sodium chloride, citric acid, phenylthiocarbamide, menthol, capsaicin) on a scale from 1 (dislike extremely, or no intensity) to 9 (like extremely, or extremely intense). There was no statistical difference in intensity ratings or liking of any sample between subjects who reported a history of COVID-19 (n = 34) and those reporting no history (n = 40), independent of presence/absence or severity of smell/taste impairments (P > 0.05). Additionally, neither vaccination status (full vaccination or no vaccination) nor time from the COVID-19 onset (2-27 months) correlated with liking or intensity.

To capture and analyze odors produced by the human body, numerous protocols and materials are used in forensics or medical studies. This paper provides an overview of sampling devices used to collect VOCs from sweat and exhaled air, for medical diagnostic purposes using canine olfaction and/or Gas Chromatography-Mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Canine olfaction and GC-MS are regarded as complementary tools, holding immense promise for detecting cancers and infectious diseases. However, existing literature lacks guidelines for selecting materials suitable for both canine olfaction and GC-MS. Hence, this review aims to address this gap and pave the way for efficient body odor sampling materials. The first section of the paper describes the materials utilized in training sniffing dogs, while the second section delves into the details of sampling devices and extraction techniques employed for exhaled air and sweat analysis using GC-MS. Finally, the paper proposes the development of an ideal sampling device tailored for detection purposes in the field of odorology.

Gold nanoparticles (Au NPs), which not only exhibit enzyme-like activity but also have the advantages of tunable localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), high stability, good biocompatibility and easily modified properties, provide excellent platforms for the construction of colorimetric sensors. They are widely used in environmental monitoring, biomedicine, the food industry and other fields. This review focuses on the chromogenic mechanisms of colorimetric sensors based on Au NPs adopting two different sensing strategies and summarizes significant advances in Au NP-based colorimetric sensing with enzyme-like activity and tunable LSPR characteristics. In addition, the sensing strategies based on the LSPR properties of Au NPs are classified into four modulation methods: aggregation, surface modification, deposition and etching, and the current status of visual detection of various analytes is discussed.

doi:10.3390/v14081686,Pathogenic Connections in Post-COVID Conditions: What Do We Know in the Large Unknown? A Narrative Review,"The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) disease has long-term effects, known as post-COVID conditions (PCC) or long-COVID. Post-COVID-19 syndrome is defined by signs and symptoms that occur during or after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection which persist for more than 12 weeks and cannot be supported by an alternative diagnosis. The cardiovascular damage caused by COVID-19 in the severe forms of the disease is induced by severe systemic inflammation, considered to be one of the causes of myocardial lesions, with increased levels of circulating cytokines and toxic response mediators. We have focused on conditions that can induce long-COVID-19, or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults or children (MIS-C/MIS-A), with an emphasis on endocrinological and metabolic disorders. Although described less frequently in children than in adults, long-COVID syndrome should not be confused with MIS-C, which is an acute condition characterized by multisystem involvement and paraclinical evidence of inflammation in a pediatric patient who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. At the same time, we mention that the MIS-A symptoms remit within a few weeks, while the duration of long-COVID is measured in months. Long-COVID syndrome, along with its complications, MIS-A and MIS-C, represents an important challenge in the medical community. Underlying comorbidities can expose both COVID-19 adult and pediatric patients to a higher risk of negative outcomes not only during, but in the aftermath of the SARS-CoV-2 infection as well.",Viruses,2022,secondary,doi:10.3390/v14081686,36016309,9413998,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/v14081686,
doi:10.1111/2041-210X.14166,Why should we compare morphological and molecular disparity?,"Indices of morphological disparity seek to summarise the highly multivariate morphological variation across groups of species within clades, time bins or other groups. Morphological variation can be quantified using geometric morphometric, outline or surface‐based methods. These are most effective when morphological differences are relatively modest and there are numerous ubiquitous landmarks and phase aligned features of shape variation. The most disparate samples, such as those across classes and phyla, typically necessitate the use of discrete characters. Unfortunately, such characters are often compiled subjectively in a manner reflecting the level of morphological and taxonomic focus and the intensity of taxon sampling. Sampling intensity is often highly variable within a single data set, especially in repurposed and amalgamated cladistic matrices. Here, we propose indices of molecular disparity analogous to those of morphological disparity. Despite numerous shortcomings discussed here, molecular sequence data can be obtained in a more objective, automated and scalable manner than morphological data. Comparisons of the morphological and molecular disparity of subclades in 16 large data sets suggest that molecular disparity is less susceptible to sampling biases than morphological disparity. Moreover, distance matrices inferred from individual genes tend to correlate strongly with each other and with distances from all concatenated genes. By contrast, morphological and molecular disparity are typically not significantly correlated across subclades, such that comparisons for groups can help to give a fuller picture of their evolution. For example, within mammals, Afrotheria have conspicuously high morphological disparity but modest molecular disparity, suggesting unusually high morphological plasticity. Even more strikingly, the molecular disparity of rodents is over five times that for Artiodactyla, despite having only half of their morphological disparity. These contrasts suggest the differential operation of geometric, biomechanical, ontogenetic and environmental constraints on form. Given the increasing abundance of total evidence datasets in the literature and the widespread and sometimes uncritical repurposing of discrete morphological matrices, we propose the comparison of morphological and molecular disparity as a useful tool to understand subclade evolution more fully.",Methods in Ecology and Evolution,2023,secondary,doi:10.1111/2041-210X.14166,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1111/2041-210X.14166,

New methodologies to screen RNA aptamers will be valuable by complementing the traditional Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX). Meanwhile, repurposing clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR associated systems (Cas) has expanded their utility far beyond their native nuclease function. Here, CRISmers, a CRISPR/Cas‐based novel screening system for RNA aptamers based on binding to a chosen protein of interest in a cellular context, is presented. Using CRISmers, aptamers are identified specifically targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike glycoprotein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2). Two aptamer leads enable sensitive detection and potent neutralization of SARS‐CoV‐2 Delta and Omicron variants in vitro. Intranasal administration of one aptamer, further modified with 2’‐fluoro pyrimidines (2’‐F), 2’‐O‐methyl purines (2’‐O), and conjugation with both cholesterol and polyethylene glycol of 40 kDa (PEG40K), achieves effective prophylactic and therapeutic antiviral activity against live Omicron BA.2 variants in vivo.

In this study we analyzed wastewater samples from three large (> 300,000 people served) and four small (< 25,000 people served) communities throughout southern Germany from August to December 2021, capturing the fourth infection wave in Germany dominated by the Delta variant (B.1.617.2). As dilution can skew the SARS-CoV-2 biomarker concentrations in wastewater, normalization to wastewater parameters can improve the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 biomarker data and clinical prevalence data. In this study, we investigated the suitability and performance of various normalization parameters. Influent flow data showed strong relationships to precipitation data; accordingly, flow-normalization reacted distinctly to precipitation events. Normalization by surrogate viruses CrAssphage and Pepper Mild Mottle Virus showed varying performance for different sampling sites. The best normalization performance was achieved with a mixed fecal indicator calculated from both surrogate viruses. Analyzing the temporal and spatial variation of normalization parameters proved to be useful to explain normalization performance.

Depending on the type of test used to measure it (self-report vs. direct test), the degree of chemosensory dysfunction in long-term COVID-19 has been found to be highly variable. In this manuscript, we report the cross-sectional data (first assessment) of a longitudinal study (6-month follow-up) examining smell, taste, and chemesthesis in participants affected by long-term COVID-19 (COVID+) and participants without COVID-19 (COVID−) by means of both self-reported and direct psychophysical methods. In total, 208 Italian participants (COVID+ n = 133; COVID− n = 75) completed the Smell and Taste Check developed by the Global Consortium for Chemosensory Research (GCCR), which includes self-reports on smell, taste, and chemesthetic abilities as well as direct intensity ratings of unstandardized smell, taste, and chemesthetic household items. Furthermore, all participants completed SCENTinel, a validated direct smell test. We found a positive association between the self-reported, unstandardized direct test and the validated direct test for smell, indicating moderate to large agreement across measures. Furthermore, the performance on SCENTinel was significantly associated with self-reported smell loss. A positive association between the self-reports and the intensity of household items was also retrieved for taste and chemesthesis. The time relative to COVID-19 onset (267.3 ± 113.9 days) did not modulate the chemosensory performance of self-reported abilities, intensity ratings, and SCENTinel. All in all, we confirm the impairment of three chemical senses (smell, taste, and chemesthesis) in an independent sample of Italian participants affected by long-term COVID-19 by using and comparing self-reported and direct psychophysical methods.

Its emergence has severely disrupted the functioning of health services and the economic and social situation worldwide. Therefore, new diagnostic and therapeutic tools are urgently needed to allow for the early detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and appropriate treatment, which is crucial for the effective control of the COVID-19 disease. The ideal solution seems to be the use of aptamers—short fragments of nucleic acids, DNA or RNA—that can bind selected proteins with high specificity and affinity. They can be used in methods that base the reading of the test result on fluorescence phenomena, chemiluminescence, and electrochemical changes. Exploiting the properties of aptamers will enable the introduction of rapid, sensitive, specific, and low-cost tests for the routine diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. Aptamers are excellent candidates for the development of point-of-care diagnostic devices and are potential therapeutic tools for the treatment of COVID-19. They can effectively block coronavirus activity in multiple fields by binding viral proteins and acting as carriers of therapeutic substances.

Availability of new vaccines and drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2 and sequelae of COVID-19 has given the world hope in ending the pandemic. However, the emergence of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome every couple of months in different parts of world is a persistent danger to public health. Currently there is no single treatment to eradicate the risk of COVID-19. The widespread transmission of SARS-CoV-2 due to the Omicron variant necessitates continued work on the development and implementation of effective vaccines. Moreover, there is evidence that mutations in the receptor domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein led to the decrease in current vaccine efficacy by escaping antibody recognition. Therefore, it is essential to actively identify the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 evades the host immune system, study the long-lasting effects of COVID-19 and develop therapeutics targeting SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans and preclinical models. In this review, we describe the pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as the innate and adaptive host immune responses to infection. We address the ongoing need to develop effective vaccines that provide protection against different variants of SARS-CoV-2, as well as validated endpoint assays to evaluate the immunogenicity of vaccines in the pipeline, medications, anti-viral drug therapies and public health measures, that will be required to successfully end the COVID-19 pandemic.",AIMS Microbiology,2023,secondary,doi:10.3934/microbiol.2023015,37091818,10113164,https://doi.org/doi:10.3934/microbiol.2023015,

M-MuLV RT is widely used in diagnostics methods, including in reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP). The performance of various reverse transcriptases in RT-LAMP remains poorly studied. Here, we report the first direct comparison of various M-MuLV RTs in RT-LAMP. The enzymes studied contained different numbers of mutations or an additional Sto7d protein. Several parameters were assessed: optimal reaction temperature, enzyme concentration, reverse transcription time, a minimal amount of RNA template, and tolerance to inhibitors. Mutations increased the optimal temperature of the reverse transcription up to 5–10 °C. All of the RTs were suitable for RT-LAMP with RNA templates in the range of 101–106 copies per reaction. Highly mutated enzymes were more tolerant to most of the inhibitors, but more sensitive to high concentrations of NaCl. The results presented could help select the optimal enzyme for novel LAMP-based diagnostic tests.

M-MuLV RT and its analogs are the most commonly used RTs. RTs are widely applied in various diagnostics methods, including reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP). However, the performance of different RTs in LAMP remains relatively unknown.

Several parameters were assessed, namely: optimal reaction temperature, enzyme concentration, reverse transcription time, a minimal amount of RNA template, and tolerance to inhibitors. Mutations increased the optimal reaction temperature from 55 °C to 60–65 °C. All of the RTs were suitable for RT-LAMP with RNA templates in the range of 101–106 copies per reaction. Highly mutated enzymes were 1.5–3-fold more tolerant to whole blood, blood plasma, and guanidinium, but they were two-fold more sensitive to high concentrations of NaCl.

doi:10.3390/idr14050076,"Roles for Pathogen Interference in Influenza Vaccination, with Implications to Vaccine Effectiveness (VE) and Attribution of Influenza Deaths","Pathogen interference is the ability of one pathogen to alter the course and clinical outcomes of infection by another. With up to 3000 species of human pathogens the potential combinations are vast. These combinations operate within further immune complexity induced by infection with multiple persistent pathogens, and by the role which the human microbiome plays in maintaining health, immune function, and resistance to infection. All the above are further complicated by malnutrition in children and the elderly. Influenza vaccination offers a measure of protection for elderly individuals subsequently infected with influenza. However, all vaccines induce both specific and non-specific effects. The specific effects involve stimulation of humoral and cellular immunity, while the nonspecific effects are far more nuanced including changes in gene expression patterns and production of small RNAs which contribute to pathogen interference. Little is known about the outcomes of vaccinated elderly not subsequently infected with influenza but infected with multiple other non-influenza winter pathogens. In this review we propose that in certain years the specific antigen mix in the seasonal influenza vaccine inadvertently increases the risk of infection from other non-influenza pathogens. The possibility that vaccination could upset the pathogen balance, and that the timing of vaccination relative to the pathogen balance was critical to success, was proposed in 2010 but was seemingly ignored. Persons vaccinated early in the winter are more likely to experience higher pathogen interference. Implications to the estimation of vaccine effectiveness and influenza deaths are discussed.",Infectious Disease Reports,2022,secondary,doi:10.3390/idr14050076,36286197,9602062,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/idr14050076,

In adults with severe COVID-19, neutrophil activation has been shown to be central to overactive inflammatory responses and complications. Thus, we sought to define neutrophil activation in children with MIS-C and acute COVID-19. We collected samples from 141 children: 31 cases of MIS-C, 43 cases of acute pediatric COVID-19, and 67 pediatric controls. We found that MIS-C neutrophils display a granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cell (G-MDSC) signature with highly altered metabolism, which is markedly different than the neutrophil interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) response observed in pediatric patients during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, we identified signatures of neutrophil activation and degranulation with high levels of spontaneous neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation in neutrophils isolated from fresh whole blood of MIS-C patients. Mechanistically, we determined that SARS-CoV-2 immune complexes are sufficient to trigger NETosis. Overall, our findings suggest that the hyperinflammatory presentation of MIS-C could be mechanistically linked to persistent SARS-CoV-2 antigenemia through uncontrolled neutrophil activation and NET release in the vasculature.

The large fragment of DNA polymerase I from Geobacillus stearothermophilus GIM1.543 (Bst DNA polymerase) possesses 5'-3' DNA polymerase activity, 5'-3' displacement activity and high processivity. These properties make it possible to use Bst DNA polymerase in loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), which provides highly specific amplification of the target sequence and is used for rapid detection of agents causing human infectious diseases. 
The purpose of the study was to produce a recombinant Bst polymerase enzyme in the bacterial expression system and to assess its properties for LAMP-based diagnostics of infectious diseases. 
Materials and methods. Expression constructs carrying the Bst polymerase gene were obtained using genetic engineering techniques. Different Escherichia coli strains were used for protein expression. Metal-chelate and gel filtration chromatography techniques were used for protein purification. Catalytic characteristics of the enzyme were assessed in loop-mediated isothermal amplification reactions using AmpliSens SARS-CoV-2-IT, AmpliSens IAV-IT and AmpliSens IBV-IT diagnostic systems designed for high-quality detection of SARS-CoV-2, influenza A virus (IAV) and influenza B virus (IBV) RNA, respectively. 
Results. The offered protocol for production, extraction and purification of recombinant Bst polymerase makes it possible to produce the enzyme in the bacterial expression system using E. coli cells in a soluble form and reaching the yield up to 20% of the total cell mass. In LAMP reactions, the obtained enzyme demonstrates activity comparable with that of the commercial enzyme Bst 2.0 (NEB). 
Conclusion. Considering the fast purification and production of the enzyme, the obtained recombinant Bst polymerase can be used in LAMP-based diagnostic kits.","Journal of microbiology, epidemiology and immunobiology",2023,secondary,doi:10.36233/0372-9311-364,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.36233/0372-9311-364,

Here, the DNA is being used as a template for in situ formation of anisotropic gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) without any chemical modification or DNA labeling. In this study, synthesized AuNPs for the direct detection of N-gene (nucleocapsid phosphoprotein) of SARS-CoV-2 are exploited. To this aim, antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) with an extra poly guanine tail (G12) were designed. Thus, in the presence of its viral target RNA gene and ASOs@AuNPs-RNA hybridization, there was a red shift in its localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), and the intensity of the LSPR peak at 690 nm of throat swab samples was compared to the threshold cycle (Ct) of a reverse-transcriptase real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) (as a gold standard).

Objective To characterize PASC-related conditions among individuals likely infected by the ancestral strain in 2020 and individuals likely infected by the Delta variant in 2021. Design Retrospective cohort study of electronic medical record data for approximately 27 million patients from March 1, 2020-November 30, 2021. Setting Healthcare facilities in New York and Florida. Participants Patients who were at least 20 years old and had diagnosis codes that included at least one SARS-CoV-2 viral test during the study period. Exposure Laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection, classified by the most common variant prevalent in those regions at the time. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s) Relative risk (estimated by adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]) and absolute risk difference (estimated by adjusted excess burden) of new conditions, defined as new documentation of symptoms or diagnoses, in persons between 31-180 days after a positive COVID-19 test compared to persons with only negative tests during the 31-180 days after the last negative test.

Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is a promising strategy to detect pathogens and may serve as an early-warning system for disease outbreaks. Notably, WBE has garnered substantial interest during the COVID-19 pandemic to track disease burden through analyses of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Throughout the COVID-19 outbreak, tracking SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater has been an important tool for understanding the spread of the virus. Unlike traditional sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from clinical samples, which adds testing burden to the healthcare system, in this study, metatranscriptomics was used to sequence virus directly from wastewater. Here, we present a study in which we explored RNA viral diversity through sequencing 94 wastewater influent samples across seven treatment plants (WTPs), collected August 2020 - January 2021, representing approximately 16 million people in Southern California. Enriched viral libraries identified a wide diversity of RNA viruses that differed between WTPs and over time, with detected viruses including coronaviruses, influenza A, and noroviruses. Furthermore, single nucleotide variants (SNVs) of SARS-CoV-2 were identified in wastewater and we measured proportions of overall virus and SNVs across several months. We detected several SNVs that are markers for clinically-important SARS-CoV-2 variants, along with SNVs of unknown function, prevalence, or epidemiological consequence. Our study shows the potential of WBE to detect viruses in wastewater and to track the diversity and spread of viral variants in urban and suburban locations, which may aid public health efforts to monitor disease outbreaks. Importance: Wastewater based epidemiology (WBE) can detect pathogens across sewersheds, which represents the collective waste of human populations. As there is a wide diversity of RNA viruses in wastewater, monitoring the presence of these viruses is useful for public health, industry, and ecological studies. Specific to public health, WBE has proven valuable during the COVID-19 pandemic to track the spread of SARS-CoV-2 without adding burden to healthcare systems. In this study, we used metatranscriptomics and RT-ddPCR to assay RNA viruses across Southern California wastewater from August 2020 - January 2021, representing approximately 16 million people from Los Angeles, Orange, and San Diego counties. We found that SARS-CoV-2 quantification in wastewater correlates well with county-wide COVID-19 case data, and that we can detect SARS-CoV-2 single nucleotide variants through sequencing. Likewise, WTPs harbored different viromes, and we detected other human pathogens such as noroviruses and adenoviruses, furthering our understanding of wastewater viral ecology.",,2021,secondary,doi:10.1101/2021.07.19.21260815,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2021.07.19.21260815,

In this work, we proposed a novel mimosa-like ternary inorganic composite with a significantly enhanced light-harvesting ability and photogenerated carrier separation rate. This ternary photoactive material was obtained via electrodeposition of gold nanoparticles (Au) on the surface of transition metal sulfide composite of CdS and NiS (CdS-NiS/Au). The experimental results showed that the high initial photocurrent was acquired on CdS-NiS/Au (68-fold higher than that of individual CdS) with the synergistic effect of p-n heterojunction, Schottky junction, and the eminent optical properties of gold nanoparticles. Meanwhile, using silver nanoclusters prepared by link DNA protection as an effective quencher, integrating the duplex-specific nuclease-assisted rolling circle amplification strategy, a ""Signal ON"" PEC biosensor was fabricated for the detection of microRNA 21 (miRNA 21). With the release of the quencher, the recovered photocurrent is able to achieve determination of miRNA 21 within the range from 10 aM to 1 pM with a detection limit down to 4.6 aM (3σ).

KD diagnoses are diagnosed based on clinical presentations, a process that still poses a challenge for front-line physicians. In the current study, we developed a novel predictor using the hemoglobin-for-age z-score (HbZ) and plasma hepcidin to differentiate Kawasaki disease (KD) from febrile children (FC). There were 104 FC and 115 KD subjects (89 typical KD; 26 incomplete KD) for this study, and data were collected on the biological parameters of hemoglobin and plasma hepcidin levels. A receiver operating characteristic curve (auROC), multiple logistics regression, and support vector machine analysis were all adopted to develop our prediction condition. We obtained both predictors, HbZ and plasma hepcidin, for distinguishing KD and FC. The auROC of the multivariate logistic regression of both parameters for FC and KD was 0.959 (95% confidence interval = 0.937–0.981), and the sensitivity and specificity were 85.2% and 95.9%, respectively. Furthermore, the auROC for FC and incomplete KD was 0.981, and the sensitivity and specificity were 92.3% and 95.2%, respectively. We further developed a model of support vector machine (SVM) classification with 83.3% sensitivity and 88.0% specificity in the training set, and the blind cohort performed well (78.4% sensitivity and 100% specificity). All data showed that sensitivity and specificity were 81.7% and 91.3%, respectively, by SVM.

Diagnosis of current HCV infections typically requires testing for HCV RNA using high-complexity laboratory tests. Methods for the detection of HCV RNA that are simple, inexpensive, rapid, and compatible with use outside of a laboratory setting are very important in order to improve access to hepatitis C diagnostic testing and facilitate accelerated linkage to care. We developed and evaluated three simple workflows for extracting HCV RNA from small volumes of whole blood for use in a sensitive, pan-genotypic RT-LAMP assay. The water workflow uses osmotic stress to release HCV RNA and has a limit of detection of 4.3 log10(IU/mL) (95% CI 4.0–4.9). The heat workflow uses a heating step to release HCV RNA and has a limit of detection of 4.2 log10(IU/mL) (95% CI 3.8–5.1). The bead workflow, which uses chemical lysis of the sample and a streamlined paramagnetic solid phase reversible immobilization bead procedure for nucleic acid purification, has a limit of detection of 2.8 log10(IU/mL) (95% CI 2.5–3.4). When used to test whole blood spiked with HCV RNA-positive plasma samples in which most HCV levels were below 5.0 log10(IU/mL), the water, heat, and bead workflows detected HCV RNA in 69%, 75%, and 94% of samples, respectively. These workflows are compatible with visual lateral flow dipsticks, and each takes less than 60 min from sample to result. Each workflow can be performed with minimal and inexpensive equipment. With further procedural simplifications, these workflows may form the basis of assays for the point-of-care diagnosis of HCV infections.",Journal of Clinical Microbiology,2023,secondary,doi:10.1128/jcm.00771-23,37933990,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1128/jcm.00771-23,

To better understand this biology, we compared the short- and long-term systemic responses in the golden hamster following either SARS-CoV-2 or influenza A virus (IAV) infection. While SARS-CoV-2 exceeded IAV in its capacity to cause injury to the lung and kidney, the most significant changes were observed in the olfactory bulb (OB) and olfactory epithelium (OE) where inflammation was visible beyond one month post SARS-CoV-2 infection.

These findings could be corroborated through sequencing of individuals who recovered from COVID-19, as sustained inflammation in OB/OE tissue remained evident months beyond disease resolution.

Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a novel, severe condition following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. Large epidemiologic studies comparing MIS-C to Kawasaki disease (KD) and evaluating the evolving epidemiology of MIS-C over time are lacking. We sought to understand the illness severity of MIS-C compared with KD and evaluate changes in MIS-C illness severity over time during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic compared with KD.


METHODS
We included hospitalizations of children with MIS-C and KD from April 2020 to May 2022 from the Pediatric Health Information System administrative database. Our primary outcome measure was the presence of shock, defined as the use of vasoactive/inotropic cardiac support or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. We examined the volume of MIS-C and KD hospitalizations and the proportion of hospitalizations with shock over time using 2-week intervals. We compared the proportion of hospitalizations with shock in MIS-C and KD patients over time using generalized estimating equations adjusting for hospital clustering and age, with time as a fixed effect.


RESULTS
We identified 4868 hospitalizations for MIS-C and 2387 hospitalizations for KD. There was a higher proportion of hospitalizations with shock in MIS-C compared with KD (38.7% vs 5.1%). In our models with time as a fixed effect, we observed a significant decrease in the odds of shock over time in MIS-C patients (odds ratio 0.98, P < .001) but not in KD patients (odds ratio 1.00, P = .062).


CONCLUSIONS
We provide further evidence that MIS-C is a distinct condition from KD. MIS-C was a source of lower morbidity as the pandemic progressed.",Pediatrics,2023,secondary,doi:10.1542/peds.2023-062101,37791428,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1542/peds.2023-062101,

We sought to assess the efficacy of one such program by analyzing wastewater RNA load data in relation to SARS-CoV-2 cases identified through individual surveillance testing. Almost 80% of the cases on campus were associated with positive wastewater tests, resulting in an overall positive predictive value of ~79% (Chi square 48.1, Df = 1, p < 0.001). However, half of the positive wastewater samples occurred in the two weeks following the return of a student to the residence hall following isolation, and therefore were not useful in predicting new infections. When these samples were excluded, the positive predictive value of a positive wastewater sample was ~54%. Overall, we conclude that the continued shedding of viral RNA by patients past the time of potential transmission confounds the identification of new cases using wastewater surveillance, and decreases its effectiveness in managing SARS-CoV-2 infections on a residential college campus.",FEMS Microbes,2021,secondary,doi:10.1093/femsmc/xtac008,37332494,10117736,https://doi.org/doi:10.1093/femsmc/xtac008,

We built and tested multiple copies of a hand-held prototype E-Nose sensor system, composed of 64 chemically sensitive nanomaterial sensing elements tailored to COVID-19 VOC detection; data acquisition electronics; a smart tablet with software (App) for sensor control, data acquisition and display; and a sampling fixture to capture exhaled breath samples and deliver them to the sensor array inside the E-Nose. The sensing elements detect the combination of VOCs typical in breath at parts-per-billion (ppb) levels, with repeatability of 0.02% and reproducibility of 1.2%; the measurement electronics in the E-Nose provide measurement accuracy and signal-to-noise ratios comparable to benchtop instrumentation. Preliminary clinical testing at Stanford Medicine with 63 participants, their COVID-19-positive or COVID-19-negative status determined by concomitant RT-PCR, discriminated between these two categories of human breath with a 79% correct identification rate using “leave-one-out” training-and-analysis methods. Analyzing the E-Nose response in conjunction with body temperature and other non-invasive symptom screening using advanced machine learning methods, with a much larger database of responses from a wider swath of the population, is expected to provide more accurate on-the-spot answers.

Though its pathogenesis is not completely understood, persistent inflammation from acute illness and the development of autoimmunity play a critical role in its development. Areas covered The mechanisms involved in the emergence of PCS, their similarities with post-viral and post-care syndromes, its inclusion in the spectrum of autoimmunity and possible targets for its treatment. Expert opinion An autoimmune phenomenon plays a major role in most causative theories explaining PCS. There is a need for both PCS definition and classification criteria (including severity scores). Longitudinal and controlled studies are necessary to better understand this new entity, and to find what additional factors participate into its development. With the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases worldwide, together with the current evidence on latent autoimmunity in PCS, we may observe an increase of autoimmune diseases (ADs) in the coming years. Vaccination’s effect on the development of PCS and ADs will also receive attention in the future.

Many countries were able to manage SARS-CoV-2 due to various strategies, like masking, social distancing, and vaccinations. Virus mutations are one of the most significant barriers to the disease's eradication;as a result, various variants have emerged (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, etc.) from time to time with higher mortality. Omicron, a variant identified from South Africa, has put the world on high alert. In this context, we have reviewed some reports on Omicron along with other variants. This new variant has been designated as a variant of concern by the World Health Organization. The preliminary reports revealed that Omicron is heavily mutated with more than 30 mutations (A67V, del69-70, T95I, del142-144, Y145D, etc.) in its spike protein. Despite vaccination with the most efficacious Pfizer candidate, Omicron infection was reported in South Africa. Bioactive lipids, such as arachidonic acid, alpha-linolenic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, and others have been reported to be the key components in inactivating the virus, so their future role is imperative.

Much of this ambiguity is due to the fact that it is exceedingly difficult and often prohibitively expensive to directly sample the deep subsurface, requiring elaborate drilling programs or access to deep mines. We propose a sampling approach which involves collection of a large suite of geological, geochemical, and biological data from numerous deeply-sourced seeps—including lower temperature sites—over large spatial scales. This enables research into interactions between the geosphere and the biosphere, expanding the classical local approach to regional or even planetary scales. Understanding the interplay between geology, geochemistry and biology on such scales is essential for building subsurface ecosystem models and extrapolating the ecological and biogeochemical roles of subsurface microbes beyond single site interpretations. This approach has been used successfully across the Central and South American Convergent Margins, and can be applied more broadly to other types of geological regions (i.e., rifting, intraplate volcanic, and hydrothermal settings). Working across geological spatial scales inherently encompasses broad temporal scales (e.g., millions of years of volatile cycling across a convergent margin), providing access to a framework for interpreting evolution and ecosystem functions through deep time and space. We propose that tectonic interactions are fundamental to maintaining planetary habitability through feedbacks that stabilize the ecosphere, and deep biosphere studies are fundamental to understanding geo-bio feedbacks on these processes on a global scale.",Frontiers in Microbiology,2022,secondary,doi:10.3389/fmicb.2022.998133,36386678,9659755,https://doi.org/doi:10.3389/fmicb.2022.998133,
doi:10.1128/msystems.00671-22,A 2-Gene Host Signature for Improved Accuracy of COVID-19 Diagnosis Agnostic to Viral Variants,"In this work, we study upper respiratory tract gene expression to develop and validate a 2-gene host-based COVID-19 diagnostic classifier and then demonstrate its implementation in a clinically practical qPCR assay. We find that the host classifier has utility for mitigating false-negative results, for example due to SARS-CoV-2 variants harboring mutations at primer target sites, and for mitigating false-positive viral PCR results due to laboratory cross-contamination. ABSTRACT The continued emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants is one of several factors that may cause false-negative viral PCR test results. Such tests are also susceptible to false-positive results due to trace contamination from high viral titer samples. Host immune response markers provide an orthogonal indication of infection that can mitigate these concerns when combined with direct viral detection. Here, we leverage nasopharyngeal swab RNA-seq data from patients with COVID-19, other viral acute respiratory illnesses, and nonviral conditions (n = 318) to develop support vector machine classifiers that rely on a parsimonious 2-gene host signature to diagnose COVID-19. We find that optimal classifiers include an interferon-stimulated gene that is strongly induced in COVID-19 compared with nonviral conditions, such as IFI6, and a second immune-response gene that is more strongly induced in other viral infections, such as GBP5. The IFI6+GBP5 classifier achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) greater than 0.9 when evaluated on an independent RNA-seq cohort (n = 553). We further provide proof-of-concept demonstration that the classifier can be implemented in a clinically relevant RT-qPCR assay. Finally, we show that its performance is robust across common SARS-CoV-2 variants and is unaffected by cross-contamination, demonstrating its utility for improved accuracy of COVID-19 diagnostics. IMPORTANCE In this work, we study upper respiratory tract gene expression to develop and validate a 2-gene host-based COVID-19 diagnostic classifier and then demonstrate its implementation in a clinically practical qPCR assay. We find that the host classifier has utility for mitigating false-negative results, for example due to SARS-CoV-2 variants harboring mutations at primer target sites, and for mitigating false-positive viral PCR results due to laboratory cross-contamination. Both types of error carry serious consequences of either unrecognized viral transmission or unnecessary isolation and contact tracing. This work is directly relevant to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic given the continued emergence of viral variants and the continued challenges of false-positive PCR assays. It also suggests the feasibility of pan-respiratory virus host-based diagnostics that would have value in congregate settings, such as hospitals and nursing homes, where unrecognized respiratory viral transmission is of particular concern.",mSystems,2022,secondary,doi:10.1128/msystems.00671-22,36507688,9948727,https://doi.org/doi:10.1128/msystems.00671-22,

The site features multiple ruins in various areas, including temples and stables, alongside modern constructions, and public access is allowed in designated areas. The site has been studied extensively since the last century; however, its microbiome has never been studied. We carried out the first survey of the microbiomes in Tel Megiddo. Our objectives were to study (i) the unique microbial community structure of the site, (ii) the variation in the microbial communities across areas, (iii) the similarity of the microbiomes to urban and archeological microbes, (iv) the presence and abundance of potential bio-corroding microbes, and (v) the presence and abundance of potentially pathogenic microbes. Methods We collected 40 swab samples from ten major areas and identified microbial taxa using next-generation sequencing of microbial genomes. These genomes were annotated and classified taxonomically and pathogenetically. Results We found that eight phyla, six of which exist in all ten areas, dominated the site (>99%). The relative sequence abundance of taxa varied between the ruins and the sampled materials and was assessed using all metagenomic reads mapping to a respective taxon. The site hosted unique taxa characteristic of the built environment and exhibited high similarity to the microbiome of other monuments. We identified acid-producing bacteria that may pose a risk to the site through biocorrosion and staining and thus pose a danger to the site’s preservation. Differences in the microbiomes of the publicly accessible or inaccessible areas were insignificant; however, pathogens were more abundant in the former.

The CoV spike (S) glycoprotein is a key target for diagnostic, development of antibodies, entry inhibitors, and vaccines. COVID-19 also recognizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as its host receptor binding to viral S protein. Several antiviral drugs and vaccines have been evaluated for the treatment and prevention of the infection by the virus. To facilitate medical countermeasure development, the problems associated with antiviral drugs and vaccines development for containing the spread of COVID-19 are discussed. There is an urgent need to study deeply on the structure, mutations, and function of COVID-19 as well as its pathophysiology from a large population.

The timing of mutational evolution and its limits are thus of paramount importance in preparedness planning. Here, we present a model predicting the pattern of epidemic growth including the emergence of variants through mutation. It is based on the SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Removed) model, but its equations are modifiable according to the transmission parameters of novel variants. Since more transmissible strains will drive a further increase in the number of cases, they will also lead to further novel mutations. As one cannot predict whether there is a viral mutational evolutionary limit, we model a cascade that could lead to hyper-exponential growth involving the emergence of even more transmissible mutants that could overwhelm systemic response. Our results are consistent with the timing, since the beginning of the pandemic, of the concurrent and independent emergence of the VOCs.

Monitoring SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in wastewater has to-date relied on genomic sequencing, which lacks sensitivity necessary to detect low variant abundances in diluted and mixed wastewater samples. Here, we develop and present an open-source method based on allele specific RT-qPCR (AS RT-qPCR) that detects and quantifies the B.1.1.7 variant, targeting spike protein mutations at three independent genomic loci highly predictive of B.1.1.7 (HV69/70del, Y144del, and A570D). Our assays can reliably detect and quantify low levels of B.1.1.7 with low cross-reactivity, and at variant proportions between 0.1% and 1% in a background of mixed SARS-CoV-2.

AS RT-qPCR results align with clinical trends, and summation of B.1.1.7 and wild-type sequences quantified by our assays strongly correlate with SARS-CoV-2 levels indicated by the US CDC N1/N2 assay.

Through the development and application of exogenous targeted contrast agents and activatable probes that can respond to a given cancer biomarker, researchers can image molecular events in vivo during cancer progression. This information can provide valuable details that can facilitate cancer diagnosis and therapy monitoring. In this tutorial review, we provide a step-by-step guide to select a cancer biomarker and subsequent approaches to design imaging agents for in vivo use. We envision this information will be a useful summary to those in the field, new members to the community, and graduate students taking advanced imaging coursework. We also highlight notable examples from the recent literature, with emphasis on the molecular designs and their in vivo PA imaging performance.

Plant endophytes promote plant growth and enhance plants’ resistance to diseases, pests, and environmental stresses. In addition, they enhance the synthesis of important secondary metabolites in plants and improve the potential applicability of plants in agriculture, medicine, food, and horticulture. In this review, we summarize the recent progress in understanding the interaction between endophytes and plants and summarize the construction of synthetic microbial communities (SynComs) and metaomics analysis of the interaction between endophytes and plants.

doi:10.1101/2021.04.05.438465,The Up state of the SARS-COV-2 Spike homotrimer favors an increased virulence for new variants,"The COVID-19 pandemic has spread widely worldwide. However, as soon as the vaccines were released – the only scientifically verified and efficient therapeutic option thus far – a few mutations combined into variants of SARS-CoV-2 that are more transmissible and virulent emerged raising doubts about their efficiency. Therefore, this work aims to explain possible molecular mechanisms responsible for the increased transmissibility and the increased rate of hospitalizations related to the new variants. A combination of theoretical methods was employed. Constant-pH Monte Carlo simulations were carried out to quantify the stability of several spike trimeric structures at different conformational states and the free energy of interactions between the receptor binding domain (RBD) and Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) for the most worrying variants. Electrostatic epitopes were mapped using the PROCEEDpKa method. These analyses showed that the increased virulence is more likely to be due to the improved stability to the S trimer in the opened state (the one in which the virus can interact with the cellular receptor ACE2) than due to alterations in the complexation RBD-ACE2, once the increased observed in the free energy values is small. Conversely, the South African variant (B.1.351), when compared with the wild type SARS-CoV-2, is much more stable in the opened state (either with one or two RBDs in the up position) than in the closed state (with the three RBDs in the down position). Such results contribute to the understanding of the natural history of disease and also to indicate possible strategies to both develop new therapeutic molecules and to adjust the vaccine doses for a higher production of B cells antibodies.

Here we provide an update on the main pediatric disorders associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recent findings MIS-C is novel postinfectious manifestation with clinical features similar to Kawasaki disease and characterized by intense systemic inflammation affecting multiple organs. Many children required intensive care therapy because of circulatory shock, usually of myocardial origin. Appropriate treatment with immunomodulatory therapies led to favorable outcomes in most patients, with recovery of overall health and cardiac dysfunction. In addition to MIS-C, a variety of other complications of COVID-19 in children have been described, including thrombotic events, neurologic manifestations, and chilblain-like lesions. There is still uncertainty about the true prevalence of long COVID in children and its distinction from pandemic-related complaints. Summary The experience gained so far with MIS-C and the other SARS-CoV-2-related complications in children and adolescents will facilitate accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Further studies are needed to elucidate the pathophysiology of MIS-C and to determine the real impact of long-COVID in the pediatric age group.",Current Opinion in Rheumatology,2022,secondary,doi:10.1097/BOR.0000000000000892,35797144,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1097/BOR.0000000000000892,

We evaluated the serological response, safety, and efficacy of the BNT162b2 vaccine in children with and without inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A prospective, multicenter, case–control study was conducted in a pediatric population, including patients with IBD, aged 12–18 years. Clinical characteristics, safety profile, and serum samples for surrogate virus-neutralizing antibody testing pre- and post-BNT162b2 vaccination were assessed. The breakthrough infection rate during the Omicron outbreak was calculated to evaluate efficacy. Fifteen controls and twenty-three patients with IBD were enrolled. After two vaccine doses, the median level of percentage inhibition was highly increased, without significant differences between the groups (control 96.9 and IBD 96.3). However, it was significantly reduced in IBD patients receiving combination therapy (anti-tumor necrosis factor-α + immunomodulators) relative to those in other therapies and controls. Serious adverse events were not observed. The breakthrough infection rate was 42.1%, without statistical differences between the groups. Immunization with BNT162b2 in patients with IBD was comparable with that in healthy adolescents in terms of immunogenicity and safety.

doi:10.1111/1751-7915.14329,Non‐A to E hepatitis in children: Detecting a novel viral epidemic during the COVID‐19 pandemic,"During the COVID‐19 pandemic, two further novel viral epidemics were described in 2022, monkeypox virus infections in men having sex with men and non‐A to E hepatitis in children. The latter occurred in the first half of 2022 with about 1000 cases worldwide, necessitating liver transplantation in 5% and causing death in 2% of patients. It took some effort to clarify the cause of the novel hepatitis epidemic. Researchers were confronted with a polymicrobial viral infection consisting of an adenovirus‐associated virus type 2 (AAV2) infection, co‐occurring with either human adenovirus type 41 (HAdV41) or herpesvirus infections; most prominently human herpesvirus type 6 (HHV‐6). AAV‐2, a small Dependovirus of the Parvovirus family, needs these helper viruses for its replication. AAV2 is used as a vector for liver‐targeting gene therapy but was not previously known to cause acute hepatitis. HAdV41 and HHV‐6 are mostly known to cause diarrhoea and febrile illnesses associated with skin rashes in children, respectively. Except for a few case reports of HHV‐6 hepatitis, HAdV and HHV‐6 are mostly known as major pathogens in immunosuppressed transplantation patients. A potential role of SARS‐CoV‐2 has also been discussed but the most popular hypothesis involves an indirect role of the COVID‐19 pandemic for this novel disease. Exposure to HHV‐6 infections occurs nearly quantitatively during the first year of life. Social distancing measures, followed by the lifting of these measures in 2022 might have caused a delayed exposure to multiple, normally benign childhood viral infections eliciting a dysregulated immune response with pathological effects for liver cells. In the fall of 2022, when these conditions were not longer met, case numbers dwindled. The hypothesis of an unequilibrated immune response instead of intrinsic cytopathic activity of the implicated viruses is further supported by the enrichment of a particular HLA allele in cases over controls.",Microbial Biotechnology,2023,secondary,doi:10.1111/1751-7915.14329,37602673,10527185,https://doi.org/doi:10.1111/1751-7915.14329,

Background ESS is often successful in providing long-term relief for patients suffering from chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Literature that uses robust measures of socioeconomic status (SES) and barriers to care to assess ESS outcomes is limited. Methods A retrospective matched cohort study of patients who underwent ESS for CRS between 1/1/2015 and 6/1/2021 at a single tertiary care academic center was conducted. White and non-White patients were matched 1-to-1 by sex and age (± 5 years). SES was evaluated using the area of deprivation index (ADI). Results Of the 298 patients included in the study, 149 are White and 149 are non-White, 111 (37.2%) have CRS with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), 141 (47.3%) had allergic rhinitis, 90 (30.2%) had asthma and 22 (7.4%) required revision ESS. Non-White patients were 3.62 times more likely to present with CRSwNP (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.2-5.96) and had 2.87 times increased odds for requiring revision ESS than age and sex-matched White patients (95% CI 1.090-7.545). The median ADI for non-White (6.00) patients was higher than for White patients (3.00) (P < .001) and 21.5% more non-White patients presented with Medicaid (P < .001). Conclusion Non-White patients undergoing ESS for CRS are more likely to present from areas with fewer resources and be underinsured.

doi:10.3389/fped.2023.1127053,Evaluation of the association of birth order and group childcare attendance with Kawasaki disease using data from a nationwide longitudinal survey,"Background Kawasaki disease (KD) is a form of pediatric systemic vasculitis. Although the etiology remains unclear, infections have been identified as possible triggers. Children with a later birth order and those who attend childcare are at a higher risk of infections due to exposure to pathogens from their older siblings and other childcare attendees. However, longitudinal studies exploring these associations are limited. Thus, we aimed to elucidate the relationship between birth order, group childcare attendance, and KD, using a nationwide longitudinal survey in Japan. Methods In total, 36,885 children born in Japan in 2010 were included. The survey used questionnaires to identify hospitalized cases of KD. We evaluated the relationship between birth order classification, group childcare attendance, and KD prevalence every year, from 6 to 66 months of age. For each outcome, odds ratios (ORs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated after adjusting for child factors, parental factors, and region of residence. Results Children with higher birth orders were more likely to be hospitalized with KD at 6–18 months of age (second child OR: 1.77, 95% CI: 1.25–2.51; third child OR: 1.70, 95% CI: 1.08–2.65). This trend was stronger for children who did not attend group childcare (second child OR: 2.51, 95% CI: 1.57–4.01; third child OR: 2.41, 95% CI: 1.30–4.43). An increased risk of KD hospitalization owing to the birth order was not observed in any age group for children in the childcare group. Conclusions Children with higher birth orders were at high risk for hospitalization due to KD at 6–18 months of age. The effect of birth order was more prominent among the children who did not attend group childcare.",Frontiers in Pediatrics,2023,secondary,doi:10.3389/fped.2023.1127053,37056943,10086172,https://doi.org/doi:10.3389/fped.2023.1127053,

Previous work has shown that trends in wastewater SARS-CoV-2 viral loads correlate well with reported COVID-19 case trends over longer time periods (i.e., months). We used detrending time series to reveal shorter sub-trend patterns (i.e., weeks) to identify leads or lags in the temporal alignment of the wastewater/case relationship. Daily incident COVID-19 cases and twice-weekly wastewater SARS-CoV-2 viral loads measured at 20 North Carolina sewersheds in 2021 were detrended using smoothing ranges of ∞, 16, 8, 4 and 2 weeks, to produce detrended cases and wastewater viral loads at progressively finer time scales. For each sewershed and smoothing range, we calculated the Spearman correlation between the cases and the wastewater viral loads with offsets of -7 to +7 days. We identified a conclusive lead/lag relationship at 15 of 20 sewersheds, with detrended wastewater loads temporally leading detrended COVID-19 cases at 11 of these sites. For the 11 leading sites, the correlation between wastewater loads and cases was greatest for wastewater loads sampled at a median lead time of 6 days before the cases were reported. Distinct lead/lag relationships were the most pronounced after detrending with smoothing ranges of 4–8 weeks, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 wastewater viral loads can track fluctuations in COVID-19 case incidence rates at fine time scales and may serve as a leading indicator in many settings. These results could help public health officials identify, and deploy timely responses in, areas where cases are increasing faster than the overall pandemic trend.",PLOS Water,2023,secondary,doi:10.1371/journal.pwat.0000140,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1371/journal.pwat.0000140,

doi:10.2196/preprints.35311,A Retrospective Analysis of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine Breakthrough – Risk Factors and Vaccine Effectiveness (Preprint),"
 BACKGROUND
 COVID-19 vaccines have demonstrated efficacy in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 while being relatively safe in trial studies. However, vaccine breakthrough infections have been reported.
 
 
 OBJECTIVE
 To identify risk factors associated with COVID-19 breakthrough infections among vaccinated individuals and to reassess the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination against severe outcomes using real-world data.
 
 
 METHODS
 We conducted a series of observational retrospective analyses using the electronic health records (EHRs) of Columbia University Irving Medical Center/New York Presbyterian (CUIMC/NYP) up to September 21, 2021. New York adult residence with PCR test records were included in this analysis. Poisson regression was used to assess the association between breakthrough infection rate in vaccinated individuals and multiple risk factors – including vaccine brand, demographics, and underlying conditions – while adjusting for calendar month, prior number of visits and observational days. Logistic regression was used to assess the association between vaccine administration and infection rate by comparing a vaccinated cohort to a historically matched cohort in the pre-vaccinated period. Infection incident rate was also compared between vaccinated individuals and longitudinally matched unvaccinated individuals. Cox regression was used to estimate the association of the vaccine and COVID-19 associated severe outcomes by comparing breakthrough cohort and two matched unvaccinated infection cohorts.
 
 
 RESULTS
 Individuals vaccinated with Pfizer/BNT162b2 (IRR against Moderna/mRNA-1273 [95% CI]: 1.66 [1.17 – 2.35]); were male (1.47 [1.11 – 1.94%]); and had compromised immune systems (1.48 [1.09 – 2.00]) were at the highest risk for breakthrough infections. Vaccinated individuals had a significant lower infection rate among all subgroups. An increased incidence rate was found in both vaccines over the time. Among individuals infected with COVID-19, vaccination significantly reduced the risk of death (adj. HR: 0.20 [0.08 - 0.49]).
 
 
 CONCLUSIONS
 While we found both mRNA vaccines were effective, Moderna/mRNA-1273 had a lower incidence rate of breakthrough infections. Both vaccines had increased incidence rates over the time. Immunocompromised individuals were among the highest risk groups experiencing breakthrough infections. Given the rapidly changing nature of the SARS-CoV-2, continued monitoring and a generalizable analysis pipeline are warranted to inform quick updates on vaccine effectiveness in real time.

The disease spread to pandemic magnitudes within a few weeks and since then we have been dealing with several waves across the world, due to the emergence of variants and novel mutations in this RNA virus. A direct outcome of these variants apart from the spike of cases is the diverse disease presentation and difficulty in employing effective diagnostic tools apart from confusing disease outcomes. Transmissibility rates of the variants, host response, and virus evolution are some of the features found to impact COVID-19 disease management. In this review, we will discuss the emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2, notable mutations in the viral genome, the possible impact of these mutations on detection, disease presentation, and management as well as the recent findings in the mechanisms that underlie virus-host interaction.

These variants of concern contain mutations affecting antigenicity, which raises concerns on their possible impact on human immune response to the virus and vaccine efficacy against them. ABSTRACT SARS-CoV-2 variants with multiple amino acid mutations in the spike protein are emerging in different parts of the world, raising concerns regarding their possible impact on human immune response and vaccine efficacy against the virus. Recently, a variant named lineage B.1.1.7 was detected and shown to be rapidly spreading across the UK since November 2020. As surveillance for these SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) becomes critical, we have investigated the use of environmental surveillance (ES) for the rapid detection and quantification of B.1.1.7 viruses in sewage as a way of monitoring its expansion that is independent on the investigation of identified clinical cases. Next-generation sequencing analysis of amplicons synthesized from sewage concentrates revealed the presence of B.1.1.7 mutations in viral sequences, first identified in a sample collected in London on 10 November 2020 and shown to rapidly increase in frequency to >95% in January 2021, in agreement with clinical data over the same period. We show that ES can provide an early warning of VOCs becoming prevalent in the population and that, as well as B.1.1.7, our method can detect VOCs B.1.351 and P.1, first identified in South Africa and Brazil, respectively, and other viruses carrying critical spike mutation E484K, known to have an effect on virus antigenicity. Although we did not detect such mutation in viral RNAs from sewage, we did detect mutations at amino acids 478, 490, and 494, located close to amino acid 484 in the spike protein structure and known to also have an effect on antigenicity. IMPORTANCE The recent appearance and growth of new SARS-CoV-2 variants represent a major challenge for the control of the COVID-19 pandemic. These variants of concern contain mutations affecting antigenicity, which raises concerns on their possible impact on human immune response to the virus and vaccine efficacy against them. Here, we show how environmental surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 can be used to help us understand virus transmission patterns and provide an early warning of variants becoming prevalent in the population. We describe the detection and quantification of variant B.1.1.7, first identified in southeast England in sewage samples from London (UK) before widespread transmission of this variant was obvious from clinical cases. Variant B.1.1.7 was first detected in a sample from early November 2020, with the frequency of B.1.1.7 mutations detected in sewage rapidly increasing to >95% in January 2021, in agreement with increasing SARS-CoV-2 infections associated with B.1.1.7 viruses.",mSystems,2021,secondary,doi:10.1128/mSystems.00353-21,34128696,8269227,https://doi.org/doi:10.1128/mSystems.00353-21,

However, many rapid workflows for SARS-CoV-2 detection and diagnosis are not amenable to the analysis of large-volume samples. Previously, our group demonstrated a technique for SARS-CoV-2 nanoparticle-facilitated enrichment and enzymatic lysis from clinical samples in under 10 min. Here, this sample preparation strategy was applied to pooled samples originating from nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs eluted in viral transport medium (VTM) and saliva samples diluted up to 1:100. This preparation method was coupled with conventional RT-PCR on gold-standard instrumentation for proof-of-concept. Additionally, real-time PCR analysis was conducted using an in-house, ultra-rapid real-time microfluidic instrument paired with an experimentally optimized rapid protocol. Following pooling and extraction from clinical samples, average cycle threshold (CT) values from resultant eluates generally increased as the pooling dilution factor increased; further, results from a double-blind study demonstrated 100% concordance with clinical values. In addition, preliminary data obtained from amplification of eluates prepared by this technique and analyzed using our portable, ultra-rapid real-time microfluidic PCR amplification instrument showed progress toward a streamlined method for rapid SARS-CoV-2 analysis from pooled samples.",Diagnostics,2022,secondary,doi:10.3390/diagnostics12061398,35741208,9221879,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/diagnostics12061398,

Supply shortages and hoarding have impacted testing capacity which has led to inefficient COVID-19 case identification and transmission control, predominantly in developing countries. Traditionally, RNA extraction is a prerequisite for conducting SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT); however, simplified methods of sample processing have been successful at bypassing typical nucleic acid extraction steps, enabling extraction-free SARS-CoV-2 NAAT workflows. These methods involve chemical and physical approaches that are inexpensive and easily accessible alternatives to overcome extraction kit supply shortages, while offering acceptable test performance.

Most individuals (>80%) have mild symptoms and recover in the outpatient setting, but detailed studies of immune responses have focused primarily on moderate to severe COVID-19. We deeply profiled the longitudinal immune response in individuals with mild COVID-19 beginning with early time points post-infection (1-15 days) and proceeding through convalescence to >100 days after symptom onset. We correlated data from single cell analyses of peripheral blood cells, serum proteomics, virus-specific cellular and humoral immune responses, and clinical metadata. Acute infection was characterized by vigorous coordinated innate and adaptive immune activation that differed in character by age (young vs. old). We then characterized signals associated with recovery and convalescence to define and validate a new signature of inflammatory cytokines, gene expression, and chromatin accessibility that persists in individuals with post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC).",bioRxiv,2021,secondary,doi:10.1101/2021.05.26.442666,34075380,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2021.05.26.442666,

To investigate the viral prevalence and clinical features, the entire population was swab tested in two sequential surveys. Here we report the analysis of 87 viral genomes, which revealed that the unique ancestor haplotype introduced in Vo’ belongs to lineage B, carrying the mutations G11083T and G26144T. The viral sequences allowed us to investigate the viral evolution while being transmitted within and across households and the effectiveness of the non-pharmaceutical interventions implemented in Vo’. We report, for the first time, evidence that novel viral haplotypes can naturally arise intra-host within an interval as short as two weeks, in approximately 30% of the infected individuals, regardless of symptom severity or immune system deficiencies.

doi:10.7150/thno.73268,"The interplay between lncRNAs, RNA-binding proteins and viral genome during SARS-CoV-2 infection reveals strong connections with regulatory events involved in RNA metabolism and immune response","Viral infections are complex processes based on an intricate network of molecular interactions. The infectious agent hijacks components of the cellular machinery for its profit, circumventing the natural defense mechanisms triggered by the infected cell. The successful completion of the replicative viral cycle within a cell depends on the function of viral components versus the cellular defenses. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are important cellular modulators, either promoting or preventing the progression of viral infections. Among these ncRNAs, the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) family is especially relevant due to their intrinsic functional properties and ubiquitous biological roles. Specific lncRNAs have been recently characterized as modulators of the cellular response during infection of human host cells by single stranded RNA viruses. However, the role of host lncRNAs in the infection by human RNA coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2 remains uncharacterized. In the present work, we have performed a transcriptomic study of a cohort of patients with different SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Our results revealed the existence of a SARS-CoV-2 infection-dependent pattern of transcriptional up-regulation in which specific lncRNAs are an integral component. To determine the role of these lncRNAs, we performed a functional correlation analysis complemented with the study of the validated interactions between lncRNAs and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). This combination of in silico functional association studies and experimental evidence allowed us to identify a lncRNA signature composed of six elements - NRIR, BISPR, MIR155HG, FMR1-IT1, USP30-AS1, and U62317.2 - associated with the regulation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We propose a competition mechanism between the viral RNA genome and the regulatory lncRNAs in the sequestering of specific RBPs that modulates the interferon response and the regulation of RNA surveillance by nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). Graphical abstract Model of interactions among lncRNA and cognate RNA-binding proteins in SARS-CoV-2 infection. According to our model, the viral genome can establish direct interactions with three core proteins (DDX3X, UPF1 and IGF2BP2) involved in mRNA metabolism and regulation of the interferon response, which are also components of a SARS-CoV-2 lncRNA-centered regulatory network. The competition between viral RNA and lncRNAs could act as a counteracting factor for the normal function of homeostatic lncRNA-centered regulatory networks, contributing to viral progression and replication.

Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) provides a gold standard assay for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, but tests are expensive and supply chains are potentially fragile, motivating interest in additional assay methods. Reverse transcription and Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) provides an alternative that uses alternative and often cheaper reagents without the need for thermocyclers. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA is typically detected using dyes to report bulk amplification of DNA; however a common artifact is nonspecific DNA amplification, complicating detection.

Based on the ultra-large-scale ab initio computational modeling of the receptor binding motif (RBM) and human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) interface we provide the details of the effect of Omicron mutations at the fundamental atomic scale level. In-depth analysis anchored in the novel concept of amino acid-amino acid bond pair units (AABPU), indicates that mutations in the Omicron variant are connected with (i) significant changes in the shape and structure of AABPU components, together with (ii) significant increase in the positive partial charge which facilitates the interaction with ACE2. The calculated bond order, based on AABPU, reveals that the Omicron mutations increase the binding strength of RBM to ACE2.

Therefore, the study and genomic surveillance of bacterial carriers of resistance in and outside of clinical settings is of utter importance. A colony of multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria identified as Klebsiella spp., by 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing, has been isolated from an urban lake in Brazil, during a drug-degrading bacterial prospection. Genomic analyses revealed the bacteria as Klebsiella pneumoniae species. Furthermore, the in silico Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) identified the genome as a new sequence type, ST5236. The search for antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) detected the presence of genes against beta-lactams, fosfomycin, acriflavine and efflux pumps, as well as genes for heavy metal resistance. Of particular note, an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase gene (blaCTX-M-15) has been detected in close proximity to siphoviridae genes, while a carbapenemase gene (KPC-2) has been found in an extrachromosomal contig, within a novel non-Tn4401 genetic element (NTEKPC).

Sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 is the key to diagnose and control its spread. The spike (S) protein is an abundant viral transmembrane protein and a suitable target protein for the selective recognition of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we report that with bovine serum albumin prescreening, a specific phage peptide targeting SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein was biopanned with the pIII phage display library. The identified phage #2 expressing the peptide (amino acid sequence: NFWISPKLAFAL) shows high affinity to the target with a dissociation constant of 3.45 ± 0.58 nM. Furthermore, the identified peptide shows good specificity with a binding site at the N-terminal domain of the S1 subunit through a hydrogen bond network and hydrophobic interaction, supported by molecular docking. Then, a sandwiched phage-based enzyme-linked chemiluminescence immunoassay (ELCLIA) was established by using phage #2 as a bifunctional probe capable of SARS-CoV-2 S1 antigen recognition and signal amplification. After optimizing the conditions, the proposed phage ELCLIA exhibited good sensitivity, and as low as 78 pg/mL SARS-CoV-2 S1 could be detected. This method can be applied to detect as low as 60 transducing units (TU)/mL SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus in 50% saliva.

For most of the 20th century, medical microbiological research was focused on understanding the virulent nature of disease-causing pathogens. More recently, advances in DNA sequencing methodologies have exposed a wider diversity of microscopic wildlife that associate with our bodies and the environments around us, and the unexpected roles they play in supporting our health.

KD is an acute systemic immune vasculitis caused by infectious factors that can be complicated by coronary artery lesions. Innate immune cells are closely associated with KD onset, but we know little regarding the expression of immunity-related genes (IRGs) and the possible immune regulatory mechanisms involved in KD. In this study, we analyzed public single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and microarray data of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from normal controls and KD patients. The results of scRNA-seq revealed myeloid cells, T cells, B cells, NK cells, erythrocytes, platelets, plasma cells, hematopoietic stem cells, and progenitor cells in the peripheral blood of patients with KD. In particular, myeloid cells were expanded and heterogeneous. Further analysis of the myeloid cell population revealed that monocytes in KD exhibited higher expression of the inflammatory genes S100A8, S100A9, and S100A12; furthermore, CD14+CD16+ monocyte clusters were associated with inflammatory responses. Microarray data revealed that activation of the innate immune response contributed to KD development and progression. Differential expression and weighted gene coexpression network analysis identified 48 differentially expressed IRGs associated with response to intravenous immunoglobulin, currently the most effective treatment of KD, although numerous patients are resistant. Protein–protein interaction analysis identified ten hub genes (IL1R1, SOCS3, IL1R2, TLR8, IL1RN, CCR1, IL1B, IL4R, IL10RB, and IFNGR1) among the IRGs. In addition, the expressions of IL1R1, SOCS3, CCR1, IL1B, and IL10RB were validated in Chinese KD patients using the real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Finally, we found that the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio could be used as a biomarker to predict responsiveness to intravenous immunoglobulin in KD. In conclusion, our data highlight the importance of innate immunity in KD pathogenesis and its potential in predicting treatment response.",Mediators of Inflammation,2023,secondary,doi:10.1155/2023/6699050,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1155/2023/6699050,
doi:10.12659/MSM.936355,Characterization of Inflammatory Factors and T Cell Subpopulations in a Murine Model of Kawasaki Disease Induced by Candida albicans Cell Wall Extracts (CAWS),"Background Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute vasculitis in children, which ranks as the main cause of acquired heart disease in children in developed countries. The etiopathogenesis of KD remains to be clarified. Our study constructed a KD murine model and monitored the alterations of inflammatory factors and T cell subpopulations. Material/Methods Candida albicans cell wall extracts (CAWS) were utilized for inducing KD murine models. After 5 days, the mice were subcutaneously injected with rhG-CSF lasting 5 consecutive days. At 4 weeks, histopathology of hearts and arteries was observed via H&E staining. Inflammatory cytokine, chemokine, and adhesion molecule expression in serum specimens was detected via RT-qPCR and ELISA. T cell subpopulations in cardiac tissues were labeled through immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. Results CAWS induced cardiac dysfunction (reduced fraction shortening, increased left ventricle end-diastolic diameter and heart weight/body weight ratio) and cardiac and vascular inflammation, which were ameliorated by rhG-CSF treatment. CAWS-induced mice had increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α), chemokine (RANTES), and adhesion molecules (MCP-1, VCAM-1, ICAM-1, E-selectin), as well as the decreased levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, G-CSF). Their levels were decreased following rhG-CSF administration. There were decreased CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD8+CD45+, Foxp3+, CD25+ and Foxp3+CD25+ T lymphocyte subpopulations and an increased CD45+ T lymphocyte subpopulation in cardiac tissues of CAWS-induced mice, which were ameliorated by rhG-CSF administration. Conclusions Our findings reveal the characteristics of inflammatory factors and T cell subpopulations in CAWS-induced KD. Moreover, rhG-CSF might be an effective therapeutic regimen against KD.",Medical Science Monitor : International Medical Journal of Experimental and Clinical Research,2022,secondary,doi:10.12659/MSM.936355,35526108,9097462,https://doi.org/doi:10.12659/MSM.936355,

Wastewater sampling has consistently proven utility to understanding SARS-CoV-2 prevalence trends and genetic variation as it represents a less biased assessment of the corresponding communities. Here, we report that ongoing monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 genetic variation in samples obtained from the wastewatersheds of the city of Louisville in Jefferson county Kentucky has revealed the periodic reemergence of the Delta strain in the presence of the presumed dominant Omicron strain. Unlike previous SARS-CoV-2 waves/emergence events, the Delta reemergence events were geographically restricted in the community and failed to spread into other areas as determined by wastewater analyses. Moreover, the reemergence of the Delta strain did not correlate with vaccination rates as communities with lower relative vaccination have been, to date, not affected. Importantly, Delta reemergence events correlate with increased public health burdens, as indicated by increased daily case rates and mortality relative to non-Delta wastewatershed communities. While the underlying reasons for the reemergence of the Delta variant remain unclear, these data reaffirm the ongoing importance of wastewater genomic analyses towards understanding SARS-CoV-2 as it enters the endemic phase.",Pathogens,2022,secondary,doi:10.3390/pathogens11111249,36365000,9697103,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/pathogens11111249,

In this study, long-read sequencing data from 41 human individuals across 19 populations were analyzed using the current version of the human reference genome assembly (GRCh38) and a telomere-to-telomere assembly of the human genome (T2T-CHM13). After excluding 142 CMRGs containing windows with a depth of coverage (DoC) significantly deviating from the average DoC value of proteincoding regions in the GRCh38 (138) or T2T-CHM13 (47) assemblies, 179 and 263 CMRGs exhibited copy number variation (CNV) signal in GRCh38 and T2T-CHM13, respectively. In addition, 451 high-impact short variants were detected in 188 CMRGs. Further, some genetic alterations were individual- or continental-superpopulation-specific, suggesting a strong need to consider genetic background differences in future genetic testing and drug design studies. Finally, side-by-side comparisons of short variant calls in CMRGs using NGS and LRS data from 13 samples indicated that 15.79% to 33.96% of high-impact short variants in different individuals could only be detected using LRS data.

First detected in October 2020, it has now spread to more than 100 countries, prompting WHO to declare it as a global variant of concern (VOC). The Delta (B.1.617.2), Delta plus (B.1.617.2.1) and Kappa (B.1.617.1) variants are all sub-lineages of the original B.1.617 variant. Prior to the inception of B.1.617, vaccine rollout, safe-distancing and timely lockdowns greatly reduced COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths. However, the Delta variant, allegedly more infectious and for which existing vaccines seemed less effective, has catalyzed the resurgence of cases. Therefore, there is an imperative need for increased surveillance of the B.1.617 variants. Efforts have been made to utilize wastewater-based surveillance for community-based tracking of SARS-CoV-2 variants, however wastewater with its low SARS-CoV-2 viral titers and mixtures of viral variants, requires assays to be variant-specific yet accurately quantitative for meaningful interpretation. Following on the design principles of our previous assays for the Alpha variant, here we report allele-specific RT-qPCR assays targeting mutations T19R, D80A, K417N, T478K and E484Q, for quantitative detection and discrimination of the Delta, Delta plus, Kappa and Beta variants in wastewater.

doi:10.1021/acsami.2c22831,Remotely Controlled Light/Electric/Magnetic Multiresponsive Hydrogel for Fast Actuations.,"As a kind of soft smart material, hydrogel actuators have extensive development prospects, but it is still difficult for these actuators to integrate multiresponsiveness, multiple remote actuation, high strength, fast responsiveness, and programmable complex deformation. Herein, we have explored an anisotropic bilayer hydrogel actuator with an Fe3O4/co-poly(isopropylacrylamide-4-benzoylphenyl acrylate) [Fe3O4/P(NIPAM-ABP)] active layer and an isotropic conductive adhesive (ICAs) passive layer based on the layer-by-layer method. Benefiting from the fibrosis and porosity of the Fe3O4/P(NIPAM-ABP) hydrogel, the ICAs-Fe3O4/P(NIPAM-ABP) hydrogel actuator has excellent mechanical strength (tensile strength of 3.1 ± 0.3 MPa) and response speed (temperature (45 °C): bending speed of 2400.3°/s; near-infrared (NIR) light: bending speed of 356.4°/s; electricity (2 V): bending speed of 180°/s; water (10 °C): recovery speed of 30.0°/s). In addition, the good photothermal properties and magnetic conductivity of Fe3O4 nanoparticles provide precise remotely controllable light- and magnetic-actuated properties for the hydrogel actuator. The Ag microsheets with excellent conductivity (1.4 × 104 S/cm) provide remotely controllable electrical-actuated property for the hydrogel actuator. Combined with the responsiveness of P(NIPAM-ABP), the actuator can achieve short-range actuation including temperature-, ethanol-, and salt-responses. More importantly, it can achieve remote actuation including light, electrical, and magnetic responses. Finally, the Fe3O4/P(NIPAM-ABP) fibers can provide excellent anisotropic structures for the actuator to achieve precise deformational programmability. Inspired by some phenomena in nature, several actuating devices with the above characteristics have been successfully developed. This study can provide a general method for multifunctional anisotropic hydrogel actuators and will provide a new strategy for exploring smart materials suitable for complex bioinspired systems.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2023,secondary,doi:10.1021/acsami.2c22831,36779704,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1021/acsami.2c22831,
doi:10.3390/jdb9040058,The Development of SARS-CoV-2 Variants: The Gene Makes the Disease,"A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged towards the end of 2019 that caused a severe respiratory disease in humans called COVID-19. It led to a pandemic with a high rate of morbidity and mortality that is ongoing and threatening humankind. Most of the mutations occurring in SARS-CoV-2 are synonymous or deleterious, but a few of them produce improved viral functions. The first known mutation associated with higher transmissibility, D614G, was detected in early 2020. Since then, the virus has evolved; new mutations have occurred, and many variants have been described. Depending on the genes affected and the location of the mutations, they could provide altered infectivity, transmissibility, or immune escape. To date, mutations that cause variations in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein have been among the most studied because of the protein’s role in the initial virus–cell contact and because it is the most variable region in the virus genome. Some concerning mutations associated with an impact on viral fitness have been described in the Spike protein, such as D614G, N501Y, E484K, K417N/T, L452R, and P681R, among others. To understand the impact of the infectivity and antigenicity of the virus, the mutation landscape of SARS-CoV-2 has been under constant global scrutiny. The virus variants are defined according to their origin, their genetic profile (some characteristic mutations prevalent in the lineage), and the severity of the disease they produce, which determines the level of concern. If they increase fitness, new variants can outcompete others in the population. The Alpha variant was more transmissible than previous versions and quickly spread globally. The Beta and Gamma variants accumulated mutations that partially escape the immune defenses and affect the effectiveness of vaccines. Nowadays, the Delta variant, identified around March 2021, has spread and displaced the other variants, becoming the most concerning of all lineages that have emerged. The Delta variant has a particular genetic profile, bearing unique mutations, such as T478K in the spike protein and M203R in the nucleocapsid. This review summarizes the current knowledge of the different mutations that have appeared in SARS-CoV-2, mainly on the spike protein. It analyzes their impact on the protein function and, subsequently, on the level of concern of different variants and their importance in the ongoing pandemic.",Journal of Developmental Biology,2021,secondary,doi:10.3390/jdb9040058,34940505,8705434,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/jdb9040058,

However, a greater reduction in bias can be achieved using a personalized reference, e.g. a diploid human reference constructed to match a donor individual’s alleles. We present a novel impute-first alignment framework that combines elements of genotype imputation and pangenome alignment. It begins by genotyping the individual from a sub-sample of the input reads. It next uses a reference panel and efficient imputation algorithm to impute a personalized diploid reference. Finally, it indexes the personalized reference and applies a read aligner, which could be a linear or graph aligner, to align the full read set to the personalized reference. This frame-work has higher variant-calling recall (99.54% vs. 99.37%), precision (99.36% vs. 99.18%), and F1 (99.45% vs. 99.28%) compared to a graph-based pangenome.

The currently available imaging probes are routinely designed by targeting a single senescence-related marker. However, the inherently high heterogeneity of senescence makes them inaccessible to achieve specific and accurate detection of broad-spectrum cellular senescence. Here, we report the design of a dual-parameter recognition fluorescent probe for precise imaging of cellular senescence. This probe remains silent in non-senescent cells, yet produces bright fluorescence after sequential responses to two senescence-associated markers, namely, SA-β-gal and MAO-A. In-depth studies reveal that this probe allows for high-contrast imaging of senescence, independent of the cell source or stress type. More impressively, such dual-parameter recognition design further allows it to distinguish senescence-associated SA-β-gal/MAO-A from cancer-related β-gal/MAO-A, compared to commercial or previous single-marker detection probes. This study offers a valuable molecular tool for imaging cellular senescence, which is expected to significantly expand the basic studies on senescence and facilitate advances of senescence-related disease theranostics.",Analytical chemistry,2023,secondary,doi:10.1021/acs.analchem.2c04223,36795559,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1021/acs.analchem.2c04223,

Design: Interviewed case-patients to elicit exposed contacts and conducted COVID-19 exposure notifications. Settings: Twenty-two COVID-19 POCT sites in NYC, the 2 NYC international airports, and 1 ferry terminal. Participants: Case-patients with rapid-positive COVID-19 test results and their named contacts. Main Outcome Measures: We quantified the proportions of interviewed individuals with COVID-19 and notified contacts and assessed the timeliness between the dates of the rapid-positive COVID-19 test results and the interviews or notifications. Results: In total, 11 683 individuals with rapid-positive COVID-19 test results were referred for contact tracing on the day of their diagnosis; 8878 (76) of whom were interviewed within 1 day of diagnosis, of whom 5499 (62%) named 11 486 contacts.

COVID-19 is even more dangerous to people with comorbidities such as cancer. Thus, it is imperative to identify the key human genes or biomarkers that can be targeted to develop novel prognosis and therapeutic strategies. The transcriptomic data provided by the next-generation sequencing technique makes this identification very convenient. Hence, mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) expression data of 2265 cancer and 282 normal patients were considered, while for COVID-19 assessment, 784 and 425 COVID-19 and normal patients were taken, respectively. Initially, volcano plots were used to identify the up- and down-regulated genes for both cancer and COVID-19. Thereafter, protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks were prepared by combining all the up- and down-regulated genes for each of cancer and COVID-19. Subsequently, such networks were analyzed to identify the top 10 genes with the highest degree of connection to provide the biomarkers. Interestingly, these genes were all up-regulated for cancer, while they were down-regulated for COVID-19. This study had also identified common genes between cancer and COVID-19, all of which were up-regulated in both the diseases. This analysis revealed that FN1 was highly up-regulated in different organs for cancer, while EEF2 was dysregulated in most organs affected by COVID-19. Then, functional enrichment analysis was performed to identify significant biological processes. Finally, the drugs for cancer and COVID-19 biomarkers and the common genes between them were identified using the Enrichr online web tool.

Based on a multi-dimensional barcoding strategy, COV-ID can be used to test thousands of samples overnight in a single sequencing run with limited labor and laboratory equipment. The sequencing-based readout allows COV-ID to detect multiple amplicons simultaneously, including key controls such as host transcripts and artificial spike-ins, as well as multiple pathogens. Here, we demonstrate this flexibility by simultaneous detection of 4 amplicons in contrived saliva samples: SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, human STATHERIN, and an artificial SARS calibration standard.

Hence, this research aimed to probe the roles of SERPINH1 in human tumors. Method: Using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database, Oncomine, and SangerBox software, the pan-cancer expression of SERPINH1 and its correlation were systematically analyzed. SERPINH1 protein information was detected by the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database and STRING database. The genomic alterations of SERPINH1 were studied using the c-BioPortal database. The influence of SERPINH1 on prognosis was analyzed using Kaplan–Meier plotter. The R package “clusterProfiler” was used for enrichment analysis to detect the role of SERPINH1. The TIMER2 database was used to further analyze the correlation between the immune cell infiltration score of TCGA samples and the expression of SERPINH1. Results: SERPINH1 overexpression was related to worse survival status in pan-cancer. In addition, high expression of SERPINH1 was positively associated with tumor stage and poor prognosis. Moreover, SERPINH1 played an important role in tumor microenvironment and immune regulation. Our study revealed that SERPINH1 expression has a strong correlation with immune cell filtration, immune regulation, chemokines, and immune checkpoints. Conclusion: Our research found that SERPINH1 was a risk factor and predictor of poor prognosis in various tumors. High expression of SERPINH1 may contribute to tumor immune-suppressive status.

doi:10.1101/2023.09.13.557552,"Measuring, visualizing and diagnosing reference bias with biastools","A goal of recent alignment methods is to reduce reference bias, which occurs when reads containing non-reference alleles fail to align to their true point of origin. However, there is a lack of methods for systematically measuring, categorizing, and diagnosing reference bias. We present biastools, which analyzes and categorizes instances of reference bias. Biastools has different sets of functionality tailored to different scenarios, i.e. (a) when the donor genome is well-characterized and input reads are simulated, (b) when the donor is well-characterized and reads are real, and (c) when the donor is not well-characterized and reads are real. When possible, biastools divides instances of reference bias into categories according to their cause: bias due to loss, flux, or local misalignment. Biastools’s scan mode detects large-scale mapping artifacts due to structural variation and flaws in the reference representation. Our findings confirm that including more variants in a graph genome alignment method results in fewer reference biases. We also find that end-to-end alignment modes are effective in reducing bias at insertions and deletions, compared to local aligners that allow soft clipping. Finally, we use biastools to characterize the ways in which using the new telomere-to-telomere human reference can improve bias at a large scale. In short, biastools is a tool uniquely focused on reference bias, making it a valuable resource as the field continues to develop new aligners and pangenome representations to reduce bias.",bioRxiv,2023,secondary,doi:10.1101/2023.09.13.557552,37745608,10515925,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2023.09.13.557552,

More specifically, clinical manifestations, prognosis, and risk factors for death among this population were explored. Method: A literature search using the PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases, for articles involving patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and undergoing MHD published between January 1, 2020, and March 13, 2022, was performed. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed to calculate the weighted mean prevalence and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) or weighted means and 95% CI. Heterogeneity among studies was assessed using I2 statistics. Results: Twenty-two studies including 13,191 patients with COVID-19 undergoing MHD were selected. The most common symptoms included fever (53% [95% CI 41%–65%]) and cough (54% [95% CI 48%-60%]); however, 17% (95% CI 11%–22%) of the cases were asymptomatic. In subgroup analysis, the proportion of male patients (65% [95% CI 58%–71%]), and patients with coronary artery disease (30% [95% CI 17%–44%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (9% [95% CI 4%–15%]) was greater in the non-survivor group compared with the survivor group. Furthermore, patients undergoing MHD, who were also positive for COVID-19, exhibited a high mortality rate (24% [95% CI 19%–28%]). Conclusions: MHD patients with COVID-19 may initially present as asymptomatic or with mild symptoms; nevertheless, in this study, these patients exhibited a higher risk for death compared with COVID-19 patients not undergoing MHD. Moreover, male sex and underlying cardiovascular and respiratory diseases increased the mortality risk.",Science Progress,2022,secondary,doi:10.1177/00368504221110858,35775141,10358525,https://doi.org/doi:10.1177/00368504221110858,

Wastewater samples were collected from on-campus sites and nine off-campus wastewater treatment plants servicing small metropolitan and rural communities. SARS-CoV-2 genome copies were quantified using droplet digital PCR and results were reported to the health department. One rural, off-campus site consistently produced higher concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 genome copies. Samples from this site were sequenced and initially contained predominately Alpha variant lineage Q.3, which transitioned to lineage Q.4. Alpha variant lineage Q.3/Q.4 was detected at this site beginning in fall 2021 and continued until summer 2023. Mutational analysis of reconstructed genes revealed divergence from the Alpha variant lineage Q.3 clinical sequence over time, including numerous mutations in the surface glycoprotein RBD and NTD. We discuss the possibility that a chronic SARS-CoV-2 infection accumulated adaptive mutations that promoted long-term infection. This study reveals that small wastewater treatment plants can enhance resolution of rare events and facilitate reconstruction of viral genomes due to the relative lack of contaminating sequences.",,2023,secondary,doi:10.1101/2023.07.26.23293191,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2023.07.26.23293191,
doi:10.1093/ofid/ofac436,Reduction in Risk of Death Among Patients Admitted With COVID-19 Between the First and Second Epidemic Waves in New York City,"Abstract Background Many regions have experienced successive epidemic waves of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) since the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with heterogeneous differences in mortality. Elucidating factors differentially associated with mortality between epidemic waves may inform clinical and public health strategies. Methods We examined clinical and demographic data among patients admitted with COVID-19 during the first (March–August 2020) and second (August 2020–March 2021) epidemic waves at an academic medical center in New York City. Results Hospitalized patients (n = 4631) had lower overall and 30-day in-hospital mortality, defined as death or discharge to hospice, during the second wave (14% and 11%) than the first (22% and 21%). The wave 2 in-hospital mortality decrease persisted after adjusting for several potential confounders. Adjusting for the volume of COVID-19 admissions, a measure of health system strain, accounted for the mortality difference between waves. Several demographic and clinical patient factors were associated with an increased risk of mortality independent of wave: SARS-CoV-2 cycle threshold, do-not-intubate status, oxygen requirement, and intensive care unit admission. Conclusions This work suggests that the increased in-hospital mortality rates observed during the first epidemic wave were partly due to strain on hospital resources. Preparations for future epidemics should prioritize evidence-based patient risks, treatment paradigms, and approaches to augment hospital capacity.",Open Forum Infectious Diseases,2022,secondary,doi:10.1093/ofid/ofac436,36131846,9452151,https://doi.org/doi:10.1093/ofid/ofac436,

However, effective therapeutic options are still rare. Drug repurposing and combination represent practical strategies to address this urgent unmet medical need. Viruses, including coronaviruses, are known to hijack host metabolism to facilitate viral proliferation, making targeting host metabolism a promising antiviral approach. Here, we describe an integrated analysis of 12 published in vitro and human patient gene expression datasets on SARS-CoV-2 infection using genome-scale metabolic modeling (GEM), revealing complicated host metabolism reprogramming during SARS-CoV-2 infection. We next applied the GEM-based metabolic transformation algorithm to predict anti-SARS-CoV-2 targets that counteract the virus-induced metabolic changes. We successfully validated these targets using published drug and genetic screen data and by performing an siRNA assay in Caco-2 cells. Further generating and analyzing RNA-sequencing data of remdesivir-treated Vero E6 cell samples, we predicted metabolic targets acting in combination with remdesivir, an approved anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug.

Whereas the precise mechanism of post-COVID syndrome is still unknown, the immune response after the first infection may play a role. Here, we performed a long-term follow-up analysis of 110 COVID-19 convalescents, analyzing the first SARS-CoV-2-directed immune response, vaccination status, long-term symptoms (approximately 2.5 years after first infection), and reinfections. A total of 96% of convalescents were vaccinated at least once against SARS-CoV-2 after their first infection. A reinfection rate of 47% was observed, and lower levels of anti-spike IgG antibodies after the first infection were shown to associate with reinfection. While T-cell responses could not be clearly associated with persistent postinfectious symptoms, convalescents with long-term symptoms showed elevated SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody levels at the first infection. Evaluating the immune response after the first infection might be a useful tool for identifying individuals with increased risk for re-infections and long-term symptoms.",Viruses,2023,secondary,doi:10.3390/v15102100,37896879,10611319,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/v15102100,

To discover the correlation of wastewater data and register data, the 2021--2022 respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) epidemic in Finland was analyzed from wastewater and the Finnish National Infectious Diseases Register. The study was performed using samples that were collected monthly from May 2021 to July 2022 from ten wastewater treatment plants that cover 40% of the Finnish population. Respiratory syncytial virus detection in 24-h composite samples of influent wastewater was performed using RT-qPCR. Respiratory syncytial virus wastewater data were positively correlated with the National Infectious Diseases Register data for the sampling week (correlation coefficient, CC min = 0.412, max = 0.865). Furthermore, the cumulative incidence of respiratory syncytial virus from the sampling week to three weeks afterward was strongly correlated with the wastewater data (CC min = 0.482, max = 0.814), showing the potential of wastewater-based surveillance for use in estimating the course of the epidemic. When the register-based incidence of RSV was at least four cases/100,000 persons/week in the sampling week, it was detected in all wastewater samples. This study showed that wastewater surveillance is useful in the surveillance of respiratory syncytial virus epidemics, and its potential in the surveillance of other epidemics should be explored further.",,2023,secondary,doi:10.1101/2023.09.04.23295011,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2023.09.04.23295011,

doi:10.3389/fimmu.2021.774018,Epidermis as a Platform for Bacterial Transmission,"The epidermis constitutes a continuous external layer covering the body, offering protection against bacteria, the most abundant living organisms that come into contact with this barrier. The epidermis is heavily colonized by commensal bacterial organisms that help protect against pathogenic bacteria. The highly regulated and dynamic interaction between the epidermis and commensals involves the host’s production of nutritional factors promoting bacterial growth together to chemical and immunological bacterial inhibitors. Signal trafficking ensures the system’s homeostasis; conditions that favor colonization by pathogens frequently foster commensal growth, thereby increasing the bacterial population size and inducing the skin’s antibacterial response, eliminating the pathogens and re-establishing the normal density of commensals. The microecological conditions of the epidermis favors Gram-positive organisms and are unsuitable for long-term Gram-negative colonization. However, the epidermis acts as the most important host-to-host transmission platform for bacteria, including those that colonize human mucous membranes. Bacteria are frequently shared by relatives, partners, and coworkers. The epidermal bacterial transmission platform of healthcare workers and visitors can contaminate hospitalized patients, eventually contributing to cross-infections. Epidermal transmission occurs mostly via the hands and particularly through fingers. The three-dimensional physical structure of the epidermis, particularly the fingertips, which have frictional ridges, multiplies the possibilities for bacterial adhesion and release. Research into the biology of bacterial transmission via the hands is still in its infancy; however, tribology, the science of interacting surfaces in relative motion, including friction, wear and lubrication, will certainly be an important part of it. Experiments on finger-to-finger transmission of microorganisms have shown significant interindividual differences in the ability to transmit microorganisms, presumably due to genetics, age, sex, and the gland density, which determines the physical, chemical, adhesive, nutritional, and immunological status of the epidermal surface. These studies are needed to optimize interventions and strategies for preventing the hand transmission of microorganisms.",Frontiers in Immunology,2021,secondary,doi:10.3389/fimmu.2021.774018,34925344,8671829,https://doi.org/doi:10.3389/fimmu.2021.774018,

To this end, we employed a novel electrostatic collector to sample air from rooms occupied by COVID‐19 patients in a major Swedish hospital. Electrostatic air sampling in conjunction with extraction‐free, reverse‐transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (hid‐RT‐PCR) enabled detection of SARS‐CoV‐2 in air from patient rooms (9/22; 41%) and adjoining anterooms (10/22; 45%). Detection with hid‐RT‐PCR was concomitant with viral RNA presence on the surface of exhaust ventilation channels in patients and anterooms more than 2 m from the COVID‐19 patient. Importantly, it was possible to detect active SARS‐CoV‐2 particles from room air, with a total of 496 plaque‐forming units (PFUs) being isolated, establishing the presence of infectious, airborne SARS‐CoV‐2 in rooms occupied by COVID‐19 patients.

We report on a nosocomial outbreak caused by a SARS-CoV-2 R.1 variant harboring an E484K mutation among 81 unvaccinated inpatients and health care professionals. ABSTRACT Examining the neutralizing capacity of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) used to treat COVID-19, as well as antibodies recovered from unvaccinated, previously vaccinated, and infected individuals, against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern (VOCs) remains critical to study. Here, we report on a SARS-CoV-2 nosocomial outbreak caused by the SARS-CoV-2 R.1 variant harboring the E484K mutation in a 281-bed psychiatric facility in New Jersey among unvaccinated inpatients and health care professionals (HCPs). A total of 81 inpatients and HCPs tested positive for SARS-Cov-2 by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR from 29 October 9 to 30 November 2020. The R.1 variant exhibits partial or complete resistance to two MAbs in clinical use, as well as 2 receptor binding domain MAbs and 4 N-terminal domain (NTD) MAbs. NTD MAbs against pseudovirus harboring single characteristic R.1 mutations highlight the role of S255F in loss of activity. Additionally, we note dampened neutralization capacity by plasma from individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection or sera from vaccinated individuals. The relative resistance of the R.1 variant is likely lower than that of B.1.351 and closer to that of P.1 and B.1.526. The R.1 lineage has been reported in 47 states in the United States and 40 countries. Although high proportions exhibited symptoms (26% and 61% among patients and HCPs, respectively) and relative antibody resistance, we detected only 10 R.1 variants from over 2,900 samples (~0.34%) collected from January to October 2021. Among 3 vaccinated individuals previously infected with R.1, we observed robust neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 wild type and VOCs. IMPORTANCE The neutralizing capacities of monoclonal antibodies used to treat COVID-19 and of those recovered from previously infected and vaccinated individuals against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) remain important questions. We report on a nosocomial outbreak caused by a SARS-CoV-2 R.1 variant harboring an E484K mutation among 81 unvaccinated inpatients and health care professionals. We note high attack rates with symptoms in nearly 50% of infected individuals, in sharp contrast to an unrelated institutional outbreak caused by the R.1 variant among a vaccinated population. We found little evidence of significant community spillover. This variant exhibits partial or complete resistance to two monoclonal antibodies in clinical use and dampened the neutralization capacity of convalescent-phase plasma from individuals with previous infection or sera from vaccinated individuals. Among three vaccinated individuals previously infected with R.1, we observed robust neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 wild type and VOCs. These findings underscore the importance of vaccination for prevention of symptomatic COVID-19 disease.",mBio,2022,secondary,doi:10.1128/mbio.02141-22,35997285,9600516,https://doi.org/doi:10.1128/mbio.02141-22,

Owing to both the super-hydrophilicity and super-lipophilicity of the cellulose-fiber based napkin, the SMP and the hydrogel can be bonded firmly by the UV-adhesive in the napkin. More importantly, this bilayer hybrid 2D sheet can be programmed by designing a different temporary shape in heat water which can be fixed easily in cool water to achieve various fixed shapes. This hybrid with a fixed temporary shape can achieve complex actuating performance based on the bi-functional synergy of temperature-triggered SMP and pH-responsive hydrogel. The relatively high modulus PU SMP achieved high to 87.19% and 88.92% shape-fixing ratio, respectively, correspond to bending and folding shapes. The hybrid actuator can actuate with the 25.71 °/min actuating speed. Most importantly, one SMP/hydrogel bi-layer hybrid sheet was repeatedly programmed at least nine times in our research to fix various temporary 1D, 2D and 3D shapes, including bending, folding and spiraling shapes. As a result, only one SMP/hydrogel hybrid can provide various complex stimuli-responsive actuations, including the reversable bending-straightening, spiraling-unspiraling. A few of the intelligent devices have been designed to simulate the movement of the natural organisms, such as bio-mimetic “paw”, “pangolin” and “octopus”. This work has developed a new SMP/hydrogel hybrid with excellent multi-repeatable (≥9 times) programmability for high-level complex actuations, including the 1D to 2D bending and the 2D to 3D spiraling actuations, which also provides a new strategy to design other new soft intelligent materials and systems.",Gels,2023,secondary,doi:10.3390/gels9050428,37233019,10218152,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/gels9050428,

The sensor consists of a millimeter-sized glass chamber manufactured using a printable glass suspension. Plasma inside the chip is generated using a custom-built power supply (900 V and 83.6 kHz), and the detector uses ∼5 W of power. Our new detection scheme is based on detecting the change in the color of plasma after the introduction of target gases. The change in color is first captured by a smartphone camera as a video output. The recorded video is then processed and converted to an image light intensity vs retention time plot (gas chromatogram) using three standard color space models (red, green, blue (RGB), hue, saturation, lightness (HSL), and hue, saturation, value (HSV)) with RGB performing the best among the three models. We successfully detected three different categories of volatile organic compounds using our new detection scheme and a 30-m-long gas chromatography column: (1) straight-chain alkanes (n-pentane, n-hexane, n-heptane, n-octane, and n-nonane), (2) aromatics (benzene, toluene, and ethylbenzene), and (3) polar compounds (acetone, ethanol, and dichloromethane). The best limit of detection of 10 ng was achieved for benzene at room temperature. Additionally, the device showed excellent performance for different types of sample mixtures consisting of three and five compounds. Our new detector readout method combined with our ability to print complex glass structures provides a new research avenue to analyze complex gas mixtures and their components.",ACS Measurement Science Au,2023,secondary,doi:10.1021/acsmeasuresciau.3c00012,37600462,10436375,https://doi.org/doi:10.1021/acsmeasuresciau.3c00012,

doi:10.1021/acs.analchem.3c04338,Mercury-Mediated Epitaxial Accumulation of Au Atoms for Stained Hydrogel-Improved On-Site Mercury Monitoring.,"Trivalent Au ions are easily reduced to be zerovalent atoms by coexisting reductant reagents, resulting in the subsequent accumulation of Au atoms and formation of plasmonic nanostructures. In the absence of stabilizers or presence of weak stabilizers, aggregative growth of Au nanoparticles (NPs) always occurs, and unregular multidimensional Au materials are consequently constructed. Herein, the addition of nanomole-level mercury ions can efficiently prevent the epitaxial accumulation of Au atoms, and separated Au NPs with mediated morphologies and superior plasmonic characteristics are obtained. Experimental results and theoretical simulation demonstrate the Hg-concentration-reliant formation of plasmonic nanostructures with their mediated sizes and shapes in the presence of weak reductants. Moreover, the sensitive plasmonic responses of reaction systems exhibit selectivity comparable to that of Hg species. As a concept of proof, polymeric carbon dots (CDs) were used as the initial reductant, and the reactions between trivalent Au and CDs were studies. Significantly, Hg atoms prevent the epitaxial accumulation of Au atoms, and plasmonic NPs with decreased sizes were in situ synthesized, corresponding to varied surface plasmonic resonance absorption performance of the CD-induced hybrids. Moreover, with the integration of sensing substrates of CD-doped hydrogels, superior response stabilities, analysis selectivity, and sensitivity of Hg2+ ions were achieved on the basis of the mercury-mediated in situ chemical reactions between trivalent Au ions and reductant CDs. Consequently, a high-performance sensing strategy with the use of Au NP-staining hydrogels (nanostaining hydrogels) was exhibited. In addition to Hg sensing, the nanostaining hydrogels facilitated by doping of emerging materials and advanced chem/biostrategies can be developed as high-performance on-site monitoring routes to various pollutant species.",Analytical chemistry,2023,secondary,doi:10.1021/acs.analchem.3c04338,38096265,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1021/acs.analchem.3c04338,

The E484K mutation in the spike protein reduces neutralization by post-vaccination sera and monoclonal antibody therapeutics. We detected the emergence of an E484K harboring variant B.1.243.1 from a common circulating variant (B.1.243) in the United States. In contrast to other instances when the E484K mutation was acquired independently in the parental lineage, genomic surveillance indicates that the B.1.243.1 variant of interest is in the process of being established in Arizona and beginning to cross state borders to New Mexico and Texas. Genomic, epidemiologic and phylogenetic evidence indicates that the B.1.243.1 variant of interest is poised to emerge.

From patient transcriptomic data, we have discovered a circulating miRNA, miR-2392, that is directly involved with SARS-CoV-2 machinery during host infection. Specifically, we show that miR-2392 is key in driving downstream suppression of mitochondrial gene expression, increasing inflammation, glycolysis, and hypoxia as well as promoting many symptoms associated with COVID-19 infection. We demonstrate miR-2392 is present in the blood and urine of COVID-19 positive patients, but not detected in COVID-19 negative patients. These findings indicate the potential for developing a novel, minimally invasive, COVID-19 detection method.

doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0271860,Practical considerations to establish a validated platform for pooled detection of SARS-CoV-2 by droplet digital PCR,"Detection of SARS-CoV-2 has created an enormous workload for laboratories worldwide resulting in a restriction at the time of massive testing. Pool testing is a strategy that reduces time and costs. However, beyond the detection of infectious diseases in blood banks, this approach is rarely implemented in routine laboratories. Therefore, what was learned from the SARS-CoV-2 pool testing should represent an opportunity to increase diagnostic capabilities. The present work, carried out in the context of a diagnostic laboratory of a public hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic, represents a contribution to this end. The main limitation of pool testing is the risk of false negatives that could have been identified by individual tests. These limitations are the dilution of samples with a low virus load during pooling and that the integrity of the sample may be affected by the quality of the sample collection. Fortunately, both limitations coincide with the main strengths of droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). ddPCR is a third-generation PCR that splits the amplification into thousands of droplets that work in parallel, increasing sensitivity and resistance to inhibitors. Therefore, ddPCR is particularly useful for pool testing. Here we show how to factor between test sensitivity and savings in test time and resources. We have identified and optimized critical parameters for pool testing. The present study, which analyzed 1000 nasopharyngeal samples, showed that the pool testing could detect even a single positive sample with a CT value of up to 30 in pools of 34 samples. This test was performed using three different standard extraction methods, the simplest being heating only, which resulted in substantial savings of extraction reagents in addition to PCR reagents. Moreover, we show that pooling can be extended to use saliva, which is less invasive and allows self-collection, reducing the risk for health personnel.",PLOS ONE,2022,secondary,doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0271860,36331920,9635689,https://doi.org/doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0271860,

Methods This was a repeated cross-sectional study and we included children who attended the 18-month health check-up provided by the Okayama City Public Health Center between January 2017 and December 2022 (n=33 484). We compared indicators of language development before (from January 2017 to February 2020) and during (from March 2020 to December 2022) the pandemic. Our primary outcome was the proportion of children who required follow-up for language development by the Public Health Center. The secondary outcome was the proportion of children who could not say three or more meaningful words. We estimated risk ratios (RRs) and their 95% CIs, adjusted for potential confounders. Results The prevalence of the primary outcome was 33.5% before the pandemic and 36% during the pandemic. Compared with before the pandemic, increased RRs for the primary and secondary outcomes were observed during the pandemic, with RRs (95% CIs) of 1.09 (1.06–1.13) for the primary outcome and 1.11 (1.05–1.17) for the secondary outcome. Although the statistical interactions were not significant, the RRs were higher for children cared for at home than those in nursery schools and with ≤3 family members than those with ≥4 family members.

However, whether COVID-19 alters the clinical course of IBD or whether IBD treatment affects the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2 is still under investigation, especially in children. Aim To assess the serological response to SARS-CoV-2 in children with IBD, and to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on the clinical course of IBD. Material and Methods This prospective study enrolled children (0–18 years) followed-up at the University Hospital of Padova for IBD, who acquired a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between 02.2020 and 02.2021. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD IgG titer was evaluated at 3 months after infection and compared to that of a control group of healthy children matched for age, sex, and COVID-19 severity. Results Twelve children with IBD (M = 5; median age 14 years) contracted COVID-19 during the study period. 11/12 patients were under immunomodulatory treatment (4/12 steroids; 6/12 azathioprine; 3/12 anti-TNFs; 2 vedolizumab; 1 ustekinumab). SARS-CoV-2 infection remained asymptomatic in 4/12 children and caused mild COVID-19 in the remaining 8. Mean anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG S-RBD titer was similar between IBD patients and controls (27.3 ± 43.8 vs. 36.8 ± 35.3 kAU/L, p = ns). No children experienced IBD flares nor required gastroenterological support during the infection period.

The race to develop a rapid, non-invasive, widely available test resulted in multiple studies examining the potential of breath to be that ‘game changing test’. Breath sampling is a non-invasive point of care test, but SAR-CoV-2 has introduced a level of danger into collection and analysis that requires a change in workflow to keep staff and participants safe. We developed a SARS-CoV 2 breath test work flow for collection and processing of breath samples in an ambulatory care setting and prospectively evaluated the protocol. Protocol development included testing the effect of respiratory filters on the integrity and reproducibility of breath samples. Methods. Prospective, observational study conducted at community COVID-19 testing sites, collecting breath samples from patients presenting for RT-PCR testing. Breath was collected via Tedlar®, and/or BioVOC-2™ as well as an environmental sample for all participants. Samples were transferred to Tenex tubes, dry purged and analyzed using a Centri automated sample introduction machine, GC, and a Bench-ToF-HD. Results. We successfully collected and processed 528 breath samples from 393 participants at community-based ambulatory COVID-19 test sites. The majority of samples were collected before vaccines were available and throughout the emergence of the Delta Variant. No staff member was infected. Conclusion.

The distribution of medications is often carried out by private vendors operating under constrained conditions. Yet patterns in medicine distribution--and their consequences--are not well understood. The aim of this study was to illuminate the challenges reported by employees of chemical shops and pharmacies throughout Accra. Our objectives are twofold: to 1) assess obstacles and challenges faced by medicine vendors during their sales of antibiotic and antimalarial medications, and 2) identify opportunities for improving community-level stewardship of antimicrobials. Methods Responses to open-ended questions from a survey of 80 shopkeepers in pharmacies and chemical shops throughout Accra were analyzed using the socioecological model of public health. Results Overall, shopkeepers most often reported constraints at the interpersonal and community levels of the socioecological model of public health. These included the prohibitive costs of medicines, customer attitudes, and customers attempts at self-medication and uninformed antimicrobial use. Other challenges included a lack of diagnostic testing, supply chain issues, and the larger economic and healthcare situation of the community. Discussion The safe and effective distribution of medications was truncated by three main sources of obstacles: financial insecurity among customers, challenges directly in the treatment of illnesses, and broader issues with the fragmented healthcare infrastructure affecting shopkeepers roles as health educators and gatekeepers of medicines. Conclusion These context-specific findings identify tractable challenges faced by medicine vendors in Ghana, with relevance to antimicrobial stewardship across resource-poor settings globally. Addressing barriers faced by shopkeepers would provide an opportunity for significantly improving the provision of medications, and ultimately healthcare, at the community level.

Subsequently, COVID-19 broke out on a global scale and formed a global public health emergency. To date, the destruction that has lasted for more than two years has not stopped and has caused the virus to continuously evolve new mutant strains. SARS-CoV-2 infection has been shown to cause multiple complications and lead to severe disability and death, which has dealt a heavy blow to global development, not only in the medical field but also in social security, economic development, global cooperation and communication. To date, studies on the epidemiology, pathogenic mechanism and pathological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2-induced COVID-19, as well as target confirmation, drug screening, and clinical intervention have achieved remarkable effects. With the continuous efforts of the WHO, governments of various countries, and scientific research and medical personnel, the public’s awareness of COVID-19 is gradually deepening, a variety of prevention methods and detection methods have been implemented, and multiple vaccines and drugs have been developed and urgently marketed. However, these do not appear to have completely stopped the pandemic and ravages of this virus.

A better definition of the pulmonary host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is required to understand viral pathogenesis and to validate putative COVID-19 biomarkers that have been proposed in clinical studies. Methods Here, we use targeted transcriptomics of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue using the NanoString GeoMX platform to generate an in-depth picture of the pulmonary transcriptional landscape of COVID-19, pandemic H1N1 influenza and uninfected control patients. Results Host transcriptomics showed a significant upregulation of genes associated with inflammation, type I interferon production, coagulation and angiogenesis in the lungs of COVID-19 patients compared to non-infected controls. SARS-CoV-2 was non-uniformly distributed in lungs (emphasising the advantages of spatial transcriptomics) with the areas of high viral load associated with an increased type I interferon response. Once the dominant cell type present in the sample, within patient correlations and patient–patient variation, had been controlled for, only a very limited number of genes were differentially expressed between the lungs of fatal influenza and COVID-19 patients. Strikingly, the interferon-associated gene IFI27, previously identified as a useful blood biomarker to differentiate bacterial and viral lung infections, was significantly upregulated in the lungs of COVID-19 patients compared to patients with influenza. Conclusion Collectively, these data demonstrate that spatial transcriptomics is a powerful tool to identify novel gene signatures within tissues, offering new insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-COV-2 to aid in patient triage and treatment.

However, over the course of the recent COVID-19 pandemic, the incidence and prevalence of chronic sequelae after acute viral infections have become increasingly appreciated as a serious health concern. Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19, alternatively described as “long COVID-19,” are characterized by symptoms that persist for longer than 28 days after recovery from acute illness. Although there exists substantial heterogeneity in the nature of the observed sequelae, this phenomenon has also been observed in the context of other respiratory viral infections including influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus. In this Review, we discuss the various sequelae observed following important human respiratory viral pathogens and our current understanding of the immunological mechanisms underlying the failure of restoration of homeostasis in the lung.

In the last year, we have experienced a progressive reduction in the incidence and severity of MIS-C, reflecting the worldwide trend. Thus, starting from the overall trend in the disease in different continents, we reviewed the literature, hypothesizing the potential influencing factors contributing to the reduction in cases and the severity of MIS-C, particularly the vaccination campaign, the spread of different SARS-CoV-2 variants (VOCs), and the changes in human immunological response. The decrease in the severity of MIS-C and its incidence seem to be related to a combination of different factors rather than a single cause. Maturation of an immunological memory to SARS-CoV-2 over time, the implication of mutations of key amino acids of S protein in VOCs, and the overall immune response elicited by vaccination over the loss of neutralization of vaccines to VOCs seem to play an important role in this change.",Pathogens,2023,secondary,doi:10.3390/pathogens12080997,37623957,10458149,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/pathogens12080997,

Current disinfection protocols do not address hard-to-access areas or may be beyond line-of-sight treatment, such as with ultraviolet radiation. The COVID-19 pandemic further underscores the demand for reliable and effective disinfection methods to sterilize a wide array of surfaces and to keep up with the supply of personal protective equipment (PPE). We tested the efficacy of Sani Sport ozone devices to treat hospital equipment and surfaces for killing Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, and Deinococcus radiodurans by assessing Colony Forming Units (CFUs) after 30 min, 1 h, and 2 h of ozone treatment. Further gene expression analysis was conducted on live E. coli K12 immediately post treatment to understand the oxidative damage stress response transcriptome profile. Ozone treatment was also used to degrade synthetic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA as assessed by qPCR CT values. We observed significant and rapid killing of medically relevant and environmental bacteria across four surfaces (blankets, catheter, remotes, and syringes) within 30 min, and up to a 99% reduction in viable bacteria at the end of 2 h treatment cycles. RNA-seq analysis of E. coli K12 revealed 447 differentially expressed genes in response to ozone treatment and an enrichment for oxidative stress response and related pathways. RNA degradation of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA was seen an hour into ozone treatment as compared to non-treated controls, and a non-replicative form of the virus was shown to have significant RNA degradation at 30 min. These results show the strong promise of ozone treatment of surfaces for reducing the risk of hospital-acquired infections and as a method for degradation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.",Genes,2022,secondary,doi:10.3390/genes14010085,36672826,9858956,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/genes14010085,

Recent findings: COVID-19 booster vaccines were given to SOTRs as a widespread practice in many transplant centers, mostly as the third and/or fourth dose in an extended vaccine series, with a significantly improved humoral response compared with the initial two-dose scheme. However, one-third of SOTRs remained unresponsive, despite these boosters. Next steps: Vaccination with standard dosing remains the most feasible strategy for attaining protection against COVID-19. Additional booster doses and temporarily holding or reducing mycophenolate mofetil/mycophenolic acid may provide immunogenicity to vaccines, according to recent studies demonstrating some efficacy with these measures. Preexposure prophylaxis with monoclonal antibodies showed benefit in immunocompromised patients but is no longer recommended by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) due to diminished efficacy against Omicron and recent variants. Screening for the presence and titers of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in SOTRs is not recommended in most clinical settings. T cell-based techniques are needed to evaluate vaccine efficacy and risk of infection.

Monitoring drug release in vivo via noninvasive bioimaging can thus have value, but it is difficult to distinguish loaded from released drug in live tissue. Here, this work describes an injectable supramolecular hydrogel that allows slow and trackable release of doxorubicin (Dox) via photoacoustic (PA) tomography. Dox is covalently linked with photoacoustic methylene blue (MB) to monitor Dox before, during, and after release from the hydrogel carrier. The conjugate (MB‐Dox) possesses an IC50 of 161.4 × 10−9 m against human ovarian carcinoma (SKOV3) cells and loads into a DNA‐clad hydrogel with 91.3% loading efficiency due to MB‐Dox's inherent intramolecular affinity to DNA. The hydrogel is biodegradable by nuclease digestion, which causes gradual release of MB‐Dox. This release rate is tunable based on the wt% of the hydrogel. This hydrogel maintains distinct PA contrast on the order of days when injected in vivo and demonstrates activatable PA spectral shifts during hydrogel degradation. The released and loaded payload can be imaged relative to live tissue via PA and ultrasound signal being overlaid in real‐time.

doi:10.1002/adfm.202302285,A Delayed Cross‐Linking Strategy for Evolvable Hydrogels,"Biological tissues grow or evolve through a series of complicated processes of matter and energy internalization, which are highly challenging to mimic in synthetic materials. Herein, a delayed cross‐linking strategy is developed to program the reactivity of cross‐linking sites and make hydrogels evolvable. The polymer networks are constructed by combining polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) with a polyzwitterion comprising both cationic quaternary ammonium and anionic phenylboronic acid groups (PQBA). Shielding of phenylboronic acid groups in ion pairs and polyzwitterion microdomains delays the cross‐linking between PVA and PQBA. Mechanical stimulations unlock the phenylboronic acid groups and dramatically accelerate the cross‐linking reaction. A simple stretching treatment makes the hydrogels stronger. Training the hydrogels with five cycles of 200% stretching results in up to ≈13.0‐ and ≈22.8‐fold of enhancements in tensile strength and maximum Young's modulus, respectively. The hydrogels can also self‐evolve in a damage‐healing process, the fracture strength and maximum Young's modulus of the hydrogels increase by at most ≈7.5‐ and ≈27.2‐fold after five times of repeated tensile rupture and self‐healing.

Therefore, standardized methods and activity levels are available for these areas. Usually, disinfectants used in these areas are characterized by their activity against test organisms (i.e., viruses, bacteria, and/or yeasts). This activity is usually determined using a suspension test in which the test organism is incubated with the respective disinfectant in solution to assess its bactericidal, yeasticidal, or virucidal activity. In addition, carrier methods that more closely reflect real-world applications have been developed, in which microorganisms are applied to the surface of a carrier (e.g., stainless steel frosted glass, or polyvinyl chloride (PVC)) and then dried. However, to date, no standardized methods have become available for addressing genetically modified vectors or disinfection-resistant oncolytic viruses such as the H1-parvovirus. Particularly, such non-enveloped viruses, which are highly resistant to disinfectants, are not taken into account in European standards. This article proposes a new activity claim known as “virucidal activity PLUS”, summarizes the available methods for evaluating the virucidal activity of chemical disinfectants against genetically modified organisms (GMOs) using current European standards, including the activity against highly resistant parvoviridae such as the adeno-associated virus (AAV), and provides guidance on the selection of disinfectants for pharmaceutical manufacturers, laboratories, and clinical users.",Viruses,2023,secondary,doi:10.3390/v15112179,38005856,10675031,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/v15112179,

The specific downstream mechanisms mediated by TRα1 that impact brain development remain to be investigated. Methods In this study, the structure, function and transcriptome of hippocampal tissue in a mouse model expressing the first RTHα mutation discovered in a patient, THRA E403X, were analyzed. RNAscope was used to visualize the spatial and temporal expression of Thra1 mRNA in the hippocampus of WT mice, which is corresponding to THRA1 mRNA in humans. The morphological structure was analyzed by Nissl staining, and the synaptic transmission was analyzed on the basis of long-term potentiation. The Morris water maze test and the zero maze test were used to evaluate the behavior. RNA-seq and quantitative real-time PCR were used to analyze the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of the hippocampal tissues in the mouse model expressing the Thra E403X mutation. Results The juvenile mutant Thra E403X mice presented with delayed neuronal migration, disordered neuronal distribution, and decreased synaptic plasticity. A total of 754 DEGs, including 361 upregulated genes and 393 downregulated genes, were identified by RNA-seq. DEG-enriched Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathways were associated with PI3K-Akt signaling, ECM−receptor interaction, neuroactive ligand−receptor interaction, and a range of immune-related pathways. 25 DEGs were validated by qPCR.

The aim of this study was to assess retrospectively the dynamics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) transmission during the very first pandemic phase (March–July 2020) in a cohort of in‐center maintenance HD patients and in nurses the same HD facility, using a phylogenetic approach. All SARS‐CoV‐2 quantitative reverse‐transcription polymerase chain reaction positive patients and nurses from our HD unit‐respectively 10 out of 98, and 8 out of 58‐ and two other positive patients dialyzed in our self‐care unit were included. Whole‐genome viral sequencing and phylogenetic analysis supported the cluster investigation. Five positive patients were usually dialyzed in the same room and same shift before their COVID‐19 diagnosis was made. Viral sequencing performed on 4/5 patients' swabs showed no phylogenetic link between their viruses. The fifth patient (whose virus could not be sequenced) was dialyzed at the end of the dialysis room and was treated by a different nurse than the one in charge of the other patients. Three nurses shared the same virus detected in both self‐care patients (one of them had been transferred to our in‐center facility). The epidemiologically strongly suspected intra‐unit cluster could be ruled out by viral genome sequencing. The infection control policy did not allow inter‐patient contamination within the HD facility, in contrast to evidence of moderate dissemination within the nursing staff and in the satellite unit.

Exposure The utility of obesity, diabetes status, ethnicity, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and socioeconomic deprivation scores were investigated as risk factors for severe COVID-19. Main outcomes and measures Severe COVID-19, defined as requiring supplemental oxygen or respiratory support, or a C reactive protein of ≥75 mg/dL (RECOVERY trial definitions), and its association with obesity, diabetes status, ethnicity, CCI, and socioeconomic deprivation. Results 63.5% (174/274 patients) developed severe disease.

More than a year into this pandemic, the COVID‐19 fatigue is still escalating and takes hold of the entire world population. Driven by the ongoing geographical expansion and upcoming mutations, the COVID‐19 pandemic has taken a new shape in the form of emerging SARS‐CoV‐2 variants. These mutations in the viral spike (S) protein enhance the virulence of SARS‐CoV‐2 variants by improving viral infectivity, transmissibility and immune evasion abilities. Such variants have resulted in cluster outbreaks and fresh infection waves in various parts of the world with increased disease severity and poor clinical outcomes. Hence, the variants of SARS‐CoV‐2 pose a threat to human health and public safety. This review enlists the most recent updates regarding the presently characterized variants of SARS‐CoV‐2 recognized by the global regulatory health authorities (WHO, CDC).

This study seeks to understand how chronic lung disease impacts SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-elicited immunity. Methods Deep immune phenotyping of humoral and cell-mediated responses to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine was performed in patients with asthma, COPD and interstitial lung disease (ILD) compared to healthy controls. Results 48% of vaccinated patients with chronic lung diseases had reduced antibody titres to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine antigen relative to healthy controls. Vaccine antibody titres were significantly reduced among asthma (p<0.035), COPD (p<0.022) and a subset of ILD patients as early as 3–4 months after vaccination, correlating with decreased vaccine-specific memory B-cells in circulation. Vaccine-specific memory T-cells were significantly reduced in patients with asthma (CD8+ p<0.004; CD4+ p<0.023) and COPD (CD8+ p<0.008) compared to healthy controls. Impaired T-cell responsiveness was also observed in a subset of ILD patients (CD8+ 21.4%; CD4+ 42.9%). Additional heterogeneity between healthy and disease cohorts was observed among bulk and vaccine-specific follicular T-helper cells. Conclusions Deep immune phenotyping of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine response revealed the complex nature of vaccine-elicited immunity and highlights the need for more personalised vaccination schemes in patients with underlying lung conditions.

However, this requires the recovery of viral nucleic acids of high quality. We developed a reusable tangential-flow filtration system to concentrate and purify viruses from wastewater for genome sequencing. A pilot study was conducted with 94 wastewater samples from four local sewersheds, from which viral nucleic acids were extracted, and the whole genome of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was sequenced using the ARTIC V4.0 primers. Our method yielded a high probability (0.9) of recovering complete or near-complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes (>90% coverage at 10× depth) from wastewater when the COVID-19 incidence rate exceeded 33 cases per 100 000 people. The relative abundances of sequenced SARS-CoV-2 variants followed the trends observed from patient-derived samples. We also identified SARS-CoV-2 lineages in wastewater that were underrepresented or not present in the clinical whole-genome sequencing data.

doi:10.3390/ijms241813847,The Development of Novel Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification Assays for the Detection and Differentiation of Virulent Newcastle Disease Virus,"Newcastle disease (ND) is a highly pathogenic viral infection of poultry with significant economic impacts worldwide. Despite the widespread use of vaccines, ND outbreaks continue to occur even within vaccinated poultry farms. Furthermore, novel Newcastle disease virus (NDV) genotypes are emerging in poultry, increasing the need for the development of rapid, accurate, and simple diagnostic methods. We therefore developed two novel sets of visual reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assays based on highly conserved regions of the HN and F genes. The limits of detection of the NDV-Common-LAMP assay, for all the NDV strains, were 103.0 EID50/0.1 mL for Kr005 and 102.0 EID50/0.1 mL for Lasota within 35 min. The sensitivity of the NDV-Patho-LAMP assay, used for the strain differentiation of virulent NDV, was 102.0 EID50/0.1 mL for Kr005. No amplification was detected for the non-NDV templates. Next, we probed 95 clinical strains and 7 reference strains with the RT-LAMP assays to assess the feasibility of their use in diagnostics. We observed no cross-reactivity across the 102 strains. Furthermore, there was 100% congruence between the RT-LAMP assays and full-length sequencing of the target genes, indicating the potential for visual RT-LAMP in the identification and differentiation of NDV. These novel RT-LAMP assays are ideally suited for the field or resource-limited environments to facilitate the faster detection and differentiation of NDV, which can reduce or avoid further spread.",International Journal of Molecular Sciences,2023,secondary,doi:10.3390/ijms241813847,37762149,10531153,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/ijms241813847,
doi:10.1002/rmv.2517,Human-virus protein-protein interactions maps assist in revealing the pathogenesis of viral infection.,"Many significant viral infections have been recorded in human history, which have caused enormous negative impacts worldwide. Human-virus protein-protein interactions (PPIs) mediate viral infection and immune processes in the host. The identification, quantification, localization, and construction of human-virus PPIs maps are critical prerequisites for understanding the biophysical basis of the viral invasion process and characterising the framework for all protein functions. With the technological revolution and the introduction of artificial intelligence, the human-virus PPIs maps have been expanded rapidly in the past decade and shed light on solving complicated biomedical problems. However, there is still a lack of prospective insight into the field. In this work, we comprehensively review and compare the effectiveness, potential, and limitations of diverse approaches for constructing large-scale PPIs maps in human-virus, including experimental methods based on biophysics and biochemistry, databases of human-virus PPIs, computational methods based on artificial intelligence, and tools for visualising PPIs maps. The work aims to provide a toolbox for researchers, hoping to better assist in deciphering the relationship between humans and viruses.",Reviews in medical virology,2024,secondary,doi:10.1002/rmv.2517,38282401,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1002/rmv.2517,

The silicon microreactor technology chemoselectively preconcentrates exhaled carbonyl volatile organic compounds and subsequent methanol elution provides samples for analysis. The underlying scientific rationale that viral infection will induce an increase in exhaled carbonyls appears to be supported by the results of the feasibility study.

In this study, we developed solvent-responsive MBs (called responsive MBs), which, in the presence of buffers, modulated the absorption and desorption capacities of NA by flipping the surface -COO-. Relative to other commercial MBs, responsive MBs exhibited similar absorption profiles and markedly enhanced desorption profiles. When applied for NA detection of complex samples, responsive MBs exhibited better performance of RNA detection than DNA, with obvious advantages in sensitivity. Specifically, the RNA and DNA desorption rates of commercial MBs were ∼85 and 82.5%, while those of responsive MBs were nearly 94 and 93.5%, respectively. Furthermore, responsive MBs exhibited remarkable extraction ability in a wide range of tissues and better performance of RNA extraction than DNA. When applied for SARS-CoV-2 detection, the responsive MBs along with the simulated digital RT-LAMP (a previously established apparatus) further improved detection efficiency, yielding a precise quantitative detection as low as 25 copies and an ultimate sensibility detection of 5 copies/mL.

In this study, we assess the contributions of local sources to ambient air within a 160,000 m2 tropical avian park (AP). We sequenced and analyzed 120 air samples from seven locations situated 160 to 400 m apart, representing distinct microhabitats. Each microhabitat contained a characteristic air microbiome, defined by the abundance and richness of its airborne microbial community members, supported by both, PCoA and Random Forest analysis. Each outdoor microhabitat contained 1% to 18.6% location-specific taxa, while a core microbiome of 27.1% of the total taxa was shared. To identify and assess local sources, we compared the AP dataset with a DVE reference dataset from a location 2 km away, collected during a year-round sampling campaign. Intersection of data from the two sites demonstrated 61.6% of airborne species originated from local sources of the AP, 34.5% from ambient air background, and only 3.9% of species were specific to the DVE reference site. In-depth taxonomic analysis demonstrated association of bacteria-dominated air microbiomes with indoor spaces, while fungi-dominated airborne microbial biomass was predominant in outdoor settings with ample vegetation. The approach presented here demonstrates an ability to identify local source contributions against an ambient air background, despite the prevailing mixing of air masses caused by atmospheric turbulences.",PNAS Nexus,2022,secondary,doi:10.1093/pnasnexus/pgac043,36713329,9802476,https://doi.org/doi:10.1093/pnasnexus/pgac043,

Traditionally, SESI-HRMS has been used for real-time breath analysis, which requires subjects to be at the location of the analytical platform. Therefore, it limits the possibilities for an introduction of this methodology in day-to-day clinical practice. However, recent methodological developments have shown feasibility on the remote sampling of exhaled breath in Nalophan® bags prior to measurement using SESI-HRMS. To further explore the range of applications of this method, we conducted a proof-of-concept study to assess the impact of the storage time of exhaled breath in Nalophan® bags at different temperatures (room temperature and dry ice) on the relative intensities of the compounds. In addition, we performed a detailed study of the storage effect of 27 aldehydes related to oxidative stress. After 2 h of storage, the mean of intensity of all m/z signals relative to the samples analyzed without prior storage remained above 80% at both room temperature and dry ice. For the 27 aldehydes, the mean relative intensity losses were lower than 20% at 24 h of storage, remaining practically stable since the first hour of storage following sample collection. Furthermore, the mean relative intensity of most aldehydes in samples stored at room temperature was higher than those stored in dry ice, which could be related to water vapor condensation issues. These findings indicate that the exhaled breath samples could be preserved for hours with a low percentage of mean relative intensity loss, thereby allowing more flexibility in the logistics of off-line SESI-HRMS studies.",Journal of Breath Research,2023,secondary,doi:10.1088/1752-7163/ad10e1,38029449,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1088/1752-7163/ad10e1,

SCENTinelTM was previously found to screen for multiple types of smell disorders. However, the effect of genetic variability on SCENTinelTM test performance is unknown, which could affect the tests validity. This study assessed performance of SCENTinelTM in a large group of individuals with a normal sense of smell to determine the test-retest reliability and the heritability of SCENTinelTM test performance. One thousand participants (36 [IQR 26-52] years old, 72% female, 80% white) completed a SCENTinelTM test at the 2021 and 2022 Twins Days Festivals in Twinsburg, OH, and 118 of those completed a SCENTinelTM test on each of the festivals two days. Participants comprised 55% percent monozygotic twins, 13% dizygotic twins, 0.4% triplets, and 36% singletons. We found that 97% of participants passed the SCENTinelTM test. Test-retest reliability ranged from 0.57 to 0.71 for SCENTinelTM subtests. Broad-sense heritability, based on 246 monozygotic and 62 dizygotic twin dyads, was low for odor intensity (r=0.03) and moderate for odor pleasantness (r=0.4).

This study describes the experience of one large urban health system in scaling HRSN screening by implementing improvement strategies over five years, from 2018 to 2023. Methods: In 2018, the health system adapted a 10-item HRSN screening tool from a widely used, validated instrument. Implementation strategies aimed to foster screening were retrospectively reviewed and categorized according to the Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC) study. Statistical process control methods were utilized to determine whether implementation strategies contributed to improvements in HRSN screening activities. Results: There were 280,757 HRSN screens administered across 311 clinical teams in the health system between April 2018 and March 2023. Implementation strategies linked to increased screening included integrating screening within an online patient portal (ERIC strategy: involve patients/consumers and family members), expansion to discrete clinical teams (ERIC strategy: change service sites), providing data feedback loops (ERIC strategy: facilitate relay of clinical data to providers), and deploying Community Health Workers to address HRSNs (ERIC strategy: create new clinical teams). Conclusion: Implementation strategies designed to promote efficiency, foster universal screening, link patients to resources, and provide clinical teams with an easy-to-integrate tool appear to have the greatest impact on HRSN screening uptake. Sustained increases in screening demonstrate the cumulative effects of implementation strategies and the health system’s commitment toward universal screening.",Journal of Clinical and Translational Science,2023,secondary,doi:10.1017/cts.2023.652,38028350,10643918,https://doi.org/doi:10.1017/cts.2023.652,

Sequencing wastewater samples provides information about human-associated and medically-important microbial populations, and may be useful to assay disease prevalence and antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Here, we present a study in which we used untargeted metatranscriptomic sequencing on RNA extracted from 275 sewage influent samples obtained from eight wastewater treatment plants (WTPs) representing approximately 16 million people in Southern California between August 2020 – August 2021. We characterized bacterial and viral transcripts, assessed metabolic pathway activity, and identified over 2,000 AMR genes/variants across all samples. Because we did not deplete ribosomal RNA, we have a unique window into AMR carried as ribosomal mutants. We show that AMR diversity varied between WTPs and that the relative abundance of many individual AMR genes/variants increased over time and may be connected to antibiotic use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Similarly, we detected transcripts mapping to human pathogenic bacteria and viruses suggesting RNA sequencing is a powerful tool for wastewater-based epidemiology and that there are geographical signatures to microbial transcription. We captured the transcription of gene pathways common to bacterial cell processes, including central carbon metabolism, nucleotide synthesis/salvage, and amino acid biosynthesis. We also posit that due to the ubiquity of many viruses and bacteria in wastewater, new biological targets for microbial water quality assessment can be developed. To the best of our knowledge, our study provides the most complete longitudinal metatranscriptomic analysis of a large population’s wastewater to date and demonstrates our ability to monitor the presence and activity of microbes in complex samples.

Data was collected from all 29 paediatric hospitals through the Swiss Paediatric Surveillance Unit (SPSU) during hospitalisation and approximately six weeks after discharge. The data was analysed after categorising the participants into three groups based on their admission status to the intensive care unit (ICU) (non-ICU, ICU-moderate) and the requirement for invasive ventilatory and/or inotropic support (ICU-severe).


RESULTS
Overall, 204 children were included of whom 194 (95.1%) had follow-up data recorded. Median age was 9.0 years (interquartile range [IQR] 6.0-11.5) and 142 (69.6%) were male. In total, 105/204 (51.5%) required ICU admission, of whom 55/105 (52.4%) received inotropic support and 14/105 (13.3%) mechanical ventilation (ICU-severe group). Echocardiography was performed in 201/204 (98.5%) children; 132 (64.7%) had a cardiac abnormality including left ventricular systolic dysfunction (73 [36.3%]), a coronary artery abnormality (45 [22.4%]), pericardial effusion (50 [24.9%]) and mitral valve regurgitation (60 [29.9%]). Left ventricular systolic dysfunction was present at admission in 62/201 (30.8%) children and appeared during hospitalisation in 11 (5.5%) children. A coronary artery abnormality was detected at admission in 29/201 (14.2%) children and developed during hospitalisation or at follow-up in 13 (6.5%) and 3 (1.5%) children, respectively. None of the children had left ventricular systolic dysfunction at follow-up, but a coronary abnormality and pericardial effusion were found in 12 (6.6%) and 3 (1.7%) children, respectively. School absenteeism at the time of follow-up was more frequent in children who had been admitted to the ICU (2.5% in the non-ICU group compared to 10.4% and 17.6% in the ICU-moderate and ICU-severe group, respectively) (p = 0.011).


CONCLUSION
Cardiac complications in children presenting with PIMS-TS are common and may worsen during the hospitalisation. Irrespective of initial severity, resolution of left ventricular systolic dysfunction is observed, often occurring rapidly during the hospitalisation. Most of the coronary artery abnormalities regress; however, some are still present at follow-up, emphasising the need for prolonged cardiac evaluation after PIMS-TS.",Swiss medical weekly,2023,secondary,doi:10.57187/smw.2023.40092,37852002,,https://doi.org/doi:10.57187/smw.2023.40092,

We hypothesized that these chemical signals could be utilized as diagnostic tools for plant diseases. VOCs from several common wheat pathogens in pure culture (Fusarium graminearum, Fusarium culmorum, Fusarium avenaceum, Fusarium poae, and Parastagonospora nodorum) were collected and compared among isolates of the same fungus, between pathogens from different species, and between pathogens causing different disease groups [Fusarium head blight (FHB) and Septoria nodorum blotch (SNB)]. In addition, we inoculated two wheat varieties with either F. graminearum or P. nodorum, while one variety was also inoculated with Blumeria graminis f.sp. tritici (powdery mildew, PM). VOCs were collected 7, 14, and 21 days after inoculation. Each fungal species in pure culture emitted a different VOC blend, and each isolate could be classified into its respective disease group based on VOCs with an accuracy of 71.4 and 84.2% for FHB and SNB, respectively. When all collection times were combined, the classification of the tested diseases was correct in 84 and 86% of all cases evaluated. Germacrene D and sativene, which were associated with FHB infection, and mellein and heptadecanone, which were associated with SNB infection, were consistently emitted by both wheat varieties. Wheat plants infected with PM emitted significant amounts of 1-octen-3-ol and 3,5,5-trimethyl-2-hexene. Our study suggests that VOC blends could be used to classify wheat diseases. This is the first step toward a real-time disease detection in the field based on chemical signatures of wheat diseases.",Frontiers in Microbiology,2022,secondary,doi:10.3389/fmicb.2021.803352,35069508,8776713,https://doi.org/doi:10.3389/fmicb.2021.803352,

This study aims to develop an easy-to-use assay for the detection of the fluoroquinolone antibiotic levofloxacin. Levofloxacin is used in human and veterinary medicine and has been detected in wastewater and river water. An RNA aptamer against levofloxacin was selected using RNA Capture-SELEX. The 73 nt long aptamer folds into three stems with a central three-way junction. It binds levofloxacin with a Kd of 6 µM and discriminates the closely related compound ciprofloxacin. Furthermore, the selection process was analyzed using a next-generation sequencing approach to better understand the sequence evolution throughout the selection. The aptamer was used as a bioreceptor for the development of a lateral flow assay. The biosensor exploited the innate characteristic of RNA Capture-SELEX to select aptamers that displace a complementary DNA oligonucleotide upon ligand binding. The lateral flow assay achieved a limit of visual detection of 100 µM. While the sensitivity of this assay constrains its immediate use in environmental testing, the present study can serve as a template for the selection of RNA aptamer-based biosensors.",Biosensors,2024,secondary,doi:10.3390/bios14010056,38275309,10813692,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/bios14010056,

With the increasing urbanization of the global population, the spread of ARGs in urban bacteria has become a more severe threat to human health. Methods In this study, we used metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) recovered from 1,153 urban metagenomes in multiple urban locations to investigate the fate and occurrence of ARGs in urban bacteria. Additionally, we analyzed the occurrence of these ARGs on plasmids and estimated the virulence of the bacterial species. Results Our results showed that multidrug and glycopeptide ARGs are ubiquitous among urban bacteria. Additionally, we analyzed the deterministic effects of phylogeny on the spread of these ARGs and found ARG classes that have a non-random distribution within the phylogeny of our recovered MAGs. However, few ARGs were found on plasmids and most of the recovered MAGs contained few virulence factors. Discussion Our results suggest that the observed non-random spreads of ARGs are not due to the transfer of plasmids and that most of the bacteria observed in the study are unlikely to be virulent. Additional research is needed to evaluate whether the ubiquitous and widespread ARG classes will become entirely prevalent among urban bacteria and how they spread among phylogenetically distinct species.",Frontiers in Microbiology,2023,secondary,doi:10.3389/fmicb.2023.1037845,36760505,9905122,https://doi.org/doi:10.3389/fmicb.2023.1037845,

Here, we present an approach to simultaneously capture host and pathogen spatial gene expression information from the same formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue section using the spatial transcriptomics technology. We applied the method to COVID-19 patient lung samples and enabled the dual detection of human and SARS-CoV-2 transcriptomes at 55 µm resolution. We validated our spatial detection of SARS-CoV-2 and identified an average specificity of 94.92% in comparison to RNAScope and 82.20% in comparison to in situ sequencing (ISS). COVID-19 tissues showed an upregulation of host immune response, such as increased expression of inflammatory cytokines, lymphocyte and fibroblast markers. Our colocalization analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2+ spots presented shifts in host RNA metabolism, autophagy, NFκB, and interferon response pathways. Future applications of our approach will enable new insights into host response to pathogen infection through the simultaneous, unbiased detection of two transcriptomes.",bioRxiv,2022,secondary,doi:10.1101/2022.03.14.484288,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2022.03.14.484288,

Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data sources PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and medRxiv from inception to 3 October 2021. Review methods Two blinded reviewers selected observational studies of adults (≥18 years) with covid-19 related dysfunction of smell or taste. Descriptive prognosis studies with time-to-event curves and prognostic association studies of any prognostic factor were included. Data extraction and synthesis Two reviewers extracted data, evaluated study bias using QUIPS, and appraised evidence quality using GRADE, following PRISMA and MOOSE reporting guidelines. Using iterative numerical algorithms, time-to-event individual patient data (IPD) were reconstructed and pooled to retrieve distribution-free summary survival curves, with recovery rates reported at 30 day intervals for participants who remained alive. To estimate the proportion with persistent smell and taste dysfunction, cure fractions from Weibull non-mixture cure models of plateaued survival curves were logit transformed and pooled in a two stage meta-analysis. Conventional aggregate data meta-analysis was performed to explore unadjusted associations of prognostic factors with recovery. Main outcome measures The primary outcomes were the proportions of patients remaining with smell or taste dysfunction. Secondary outcomes were the odds ratios of prognostic variables associated with recovery of smell and taste. Results 18 studies (3699 patients) from 4180 records were included in reconstructed IPD meta-analyses. Risk of bias was low to moderate; conclusions remained unaltered after exclusion of four high risk studies. Evidence quality was moderate to high. Based on parametric cure modelling, persistent self-reported smell and taste dysfunction could develop in an estimated 5.6% (95% confidence interval 2.7% to 11.0%, I2=70%, τ2=0.756, 95% prediction interval 0.7% to 33.5%) and 4.4% (1.2% to 14.6%, I2=67%, τ2=0.684, 95% prediction interval 0.0% to 49.0%) of patients, respectively. Sensitivity analyses suggest these could be underestimates. At 30, 60, 90, and 180 days, respectively, 74.1% (95% confidence interval 64.0% to 81.3%), 85.8% (77.6% to 90.9%), 90.0% (83.3% to 94.0%), and 95.7% (89.5% to 98.3%) of patients recovered their sense of smell (I2=0.0-77.2%, τ2=0.006-0.050) and 78.8% (70.5% to 84.7%), 87.7% (82.0% to 91.6%), 90.3% (83.5% to 94.3%), and 98.0% (92.2% to 95.5%) recovered their sense of taste (range of I2=0.0-72.1%, τ2=0.000-0.015). Women were less likely to recover their sense of smell (odds ratio 0.52, 95% confidence interval 0.37 to 0.72, seven studies, I2=20%, τ2=0.0224) and taste (0.31, 0.13 to 0.72, seven studies, I2=78%, τ2=0.5121) than men, and patients with greater initial severity of dysfunction (0.48, 0.31 to 0.73, five studies, I2=10%, τ2<0.001) or nasal congestion (0.42, 0.18 to 0.97, three studies, I2=0%, τ2<0.001) were less likely to recover their sense of smell. Conclusions A substantial proportion of patients with covid-19 might develop long lasting change in their sense of smell or taste. This could contribute to the growing burden of long covid.

Patient:innen mit infektbedingtem Riechverlust während der SARS-CoV2 Pandemie bewusst. Wir reagieren z. B. auf Körpergerüche unserer Mitmenschen – die Nase bestimmt/wen wir „riechen können“. Der Geruchssinn warnt uns vor Gefahren, die Wahrnehmung von Düften und die Wahrnehmung von Aromen beim Essen bedeuten Lebensqualität. Eine Anosmie muss daher ernst genommen werden. Obwohl sich olfaktorische Rezeptorneurone durch Regenerationsfähigkeit auszeichnen, sind Anosmien mit etwa 5% relativ häufig. Riechstörungen werden nach der Ursache eingeteilt (z. B. Infekte, Schädelhirntraumen, chronische Rhinosinusitis, Alter) mit den sich daraus ergebenden unterschiedlichen Therapieoptionen und Prognosen. Eine gründliche Anamnese ist deshalb bedeutsam. Zur Diagnostik stehen verschiedenste Untersuchungsverfahren zur Verfügung, von orientierenden Kurztests über ausführliche mehrdimensionale Testverfahren bis hin zu elektrophysiologischen und bildgebenden Methoden. Damit sind quantitative Riechstörungen gut erfassbar und nachverfolgbar. Bei qualitativen Riechstörungen wie der Parosmie stehen derzeit allerdings keine objektivierenden Diagnoseverfahren zur Verfügung. Die therapeutischen Möglichkeiten bei Riechstörungen sind begrenzt. Trotzdem stehen mit dem Riechtraining sowie verschiedenen additiven medikamentösen Möglichkeiten wirksame Optionen zur Verfügung. Von großer Bedeutung ist nach wie vor die Beratung und das kompetente Gespräch mit den Patient:innen. Abstract The sense of smell is important. This became especially clear to patients with infection-related olfactory loss during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We react, for example, to the body odors of other humans. The sense of smell warns us of danger, and it allows us to perceive flavors when eating and drinking. In essence, this means quality of life. Therefore, anosmia must be taken seriously. Although olfactory receptor neurons are characterized by regenerative capacity, anosmia is relatively common with about 5 % of anosmic people in the general population. Olfactory disorders are classified according to their causes (e. g., infections of the upper respiratory tract, traumatic brain injury, chronic rhinosinusitis, age) with the resulting different therapeutic options and prognoses. Thorough history taking is therefore important. A wide variety of tools are available for diagnosis, ranging from short screening tests and detailed multidimensional test procedures to electrophysiological and imaging methods. Thus, quantitative olfactory disorders are easily assessable and traceable. For qualitative olfactory disorders such as parosmia, however, no objectifying diagnostic procedures are currently available. Therapeutic options for olfactory disorders are limited. Nevertheless, there are effective options consisting of olfactory training as well as various additive drug therapies. The consultation and the competent discussion with the patients are of major importance.",Laryngo- Rhino- Otologie,2023,secondary,doi:10.1055/a-1957-3267,37130532,10184680,https://doi.org/doi:10.1055/a-1957-3267,

doi:10.1101/2021.06.28.21259639,COVID-19 Has Long Term Effects on Chemosensory Functions,"Importance: A number of studies have revealed either self-reported chemosensory alterations in large groups or objective quantified chemosensory impairments in smaller populations of patients diagnosed with COVID-19. However, due to the great variability in published results regarding COVID-19-induced chemosensory impairments and their follow-up, prognosis for chemosensory functions in patients with such complaints remains unclear. Objective: To describe the various chemosensory alterations associated with COVID-19 and their prevalence and evolution at 3 to 7 months after infection. Design, Setting, and Participants: A follow-up study of 704 health care workers with a RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between 28/2/2020 and 14/6/2020 was conducted 3 to 7 months after onset of symptoms. Data were collected with an online questionnaire. Participant had to be [≥]18 years old without respiratory illness in the 2 weeks prior to questionnaire completion. Main outcomes and measures: Outcomes included differences in reported chemosensory self-assessment of olfactory, gustatory, and trigeminal functions across time points and Chemosensory Perception Test scores from an easy-to-use at-home self-administered chemosensory test. Results: Among the 704 health care worker participants, 593 (84.2%) were women, the mean (SD) age was 42 (12) years and the questionnaire was answered on average 4.8 (0.8) months after COVID-19. During COVID-19, a decrease in olfactory, gustatory, and trigeminal sensitivities were reported by 81.3%, 81.5% and 48.0% respectively. Three to seven months later, reduced sensitivity was still reported by 52.0%, 41.9% and 23.3% respectively. Chemosensory Perception Test scores indicate that 19.5% of participants had objective olfactory impairment. Conclusions and relevance: A significant proportion of COVID-19 cases have persistent chemosensory impairments at 3 to 7 months after their infection but the majority of those who had completely lost their olfactory, gustatory and trigeminal sensitivity have improved. Given the possible neurological underpinnings of this observation and the important number of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, further longitudinal studies are needed to better characterize this phenotype and to report eventual post-COVID-19 neurological sequelae.",,2021,secondary,doi:10.1101/2021.06.28.21259639,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2021.06.28.21259639,

The aim of this study is to investigate the value of peripheral blood (PB) parameters available on admission in predicting the need for PICU admission and MV due to pneumonia caused by hPIVs. A total of 331 cases including 277 (83.69%) on the general ward (GW) and 54 (16.31%) on the PICU were enrolled between January 2016 and June 2021. Of 54 patients admitted to the PICU, 24 patients (7.25%) received MV, whereas 30 (9.06%) did not. For both the PICU and GW groups, infants accounted for the highest proportion while school children had the lowest. Compared with the GW group, the PICU group had significantly higher rates of premature birth, fatigue, sore throat, headache, chest pain, tachypnea, dyspnea, and underlying diseases including congenital tracheal stenosis, congenital heart disease (CHD), metabolic disorder, and neurological disorder (ND), but significant lower proportion of exclusive breastfeeding and Z‐scores for weight‐for‐height, weight‐for‐age, height‐for‐age, and body‐mass‐index (BMI)‐for‐age (BMIZ). Higher levels of some leukocyte differential counts (LDC)‐related parameters including counts of neutrophil (N), ratios of neutrophil‐to‐lymphocyte ratio (NLR), derived neutrophils/(leukocytes minus neutrophils) ratio (dNLR), and platelet‐to‐lymphocyte ratio (PLR), lower levels of some other LDC‐related parameters including lymphocyte (L) and monocyte (M) counts, ratios of lymphocyte‐to‐monocyte ratio (LMR), lymphocyte‐to‐C‐reactive protein ratio, and prognostic nutritional index (PNI), and lower levels of PB protein (PBP)‐related parameters including red blood cell (RBC), hemoglobin, total protein (TP), and serum albumin were observed in the PB of patients in the PICU compared with those in the GW. Notably, higher PLR level and two comorbidities including CHD and ND were identified as independent risk factors for PICU admission, while lower PNI level as well as smaller numbers of RBC and L as good predictors. Low levels of TP might be a useful predictor of the need for MV. Overall, the relative contributions of LDC‐ and PBP‐related factors for accurate identification of patients required PICU admission accounted for 53.69% and 46.31%, respectively. Thus, determination of whether a patient with hPIVs‐induced pneumonia is admitted to PICU involves consideration of both the LDC‐ and PBP‐related parameters.",Journal of Medical Virology,2023,secondary,doi:10.1002/jmv.28752,37185836,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1002/jmv.28752,

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the utility of albumin, transferrin and transthyretin levels in the assessment of nutritional status and IBD activity. The case–control study included 82 IBD patients. The serum concentrations of albumin, transferrin and transthyretine were determined by a quantitative sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Significantly lower median concentrations of albumin were found in the IBD patients vs. controls and in CD patients compared to the UC patients. Significantly higher median transthyretin concentrations were found in the IBD patients compared to the healthy subjects. There were no significant differences in median transferrin concentrations between the IBD patients and the healthy subjects. Significantly higher albumin levels were found in IBD patients in remission compared to patients with moderate and severe exacerbation of IBD symptoms. There were no significant differences in the median transferrin or transthyretin levels in patients with IBD depending on disease activity. No differences were identified in the median transferrin or transthyretin levels in the IBD patients according to nutritional status. The median albumin concentrations in the IBD subjects were significantly higher in patients with normal body fat, normal BMI and normal waist circumferences compared to those with an abnormal nutritional status. The albumin levels reflect both nutritional status and disease activity and therefore cannot be considered a prognostic marker of malnutrition in IBD.

Results Data analysis of the research were taken from the certified ELISA and LFIA+S, which indicated a high consistency (Pearson’s r=0.864; ICC=0.90138) between the 2 methods. Conclusions The dataset demonstrated that LFIA+S was affordable, had a strong correlation with results of the cPass nAbs detection kit, and has potential clinical applications, with an exclusive feature that allows non-experts to use it with ease.

In vivo experiments validate that the ""nanobomb"" enables high-performance NIR-II fluorescence, infrared thermal, and ultrasound (AB decomposition during the photothermal process to produce numerous CO2/NH3 bubbles, which is an efficient ultrasound contrast agent) imaging of multidrug-resistant bacteria-infected foci after intravenous administration of AIE-Tei@AB NVs followed by 660 nm laser stimulation. The highly efficient photothermal and photodynamic features of AIE-Tei@AB NVs, combined with the excellent pharmacological property of rapidly released Tei during bubble generation and NV disintegration, collectively promote broad-spectrum eradication of three clinically isolated multidrug-resistant bacteria strains and rapid healing of infected wounds. This multimodal imaging-guided synergistic therapeutic strategy can be extended for the theranostics of superbugs.",ACS nano,2023,secondary,doi:10.1021/acsnano.2c10694,36826229,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1021/acsnano.2c10694,

Surface plasmon-coupled emission (SPCE) technology has emerged as an effective POC diagnostic tool for developing robust biosensing frameworks. The simplicity, robustness and relevance of the technology has attracted researchers in physical, chemical and biological milieu on account of its unique attributes such as high specificity, sensitivity, low background noise, highly polarized, sharply directional, excellent spectral resolution capabilities. In the past decade, numerous nano-fabrication methods have been developed for augmenting the performance of the conventional SPCE technology. Among them the utility of plasmonic gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) has enabled the demonstration of plethora of reliable biosensing platforms. Here, we review the nano-engineering and biosensing applications of AuNPs based on the shape, hollow morphology, metal–dielectric, nano-assembly and heterometallic nanohybrids under optical as well as biosensing competencies.

The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of both quantitative and qualitative features of COVID-19-associated OD on BMI; (2) Methods: Recruitment of thirty-one participants with self-reported OD in the form of quantitative loss with and without qualitative features. Surveys with questions specific to qualitative olfactory function, Sniffin’ Sticks tests, and BMI measures were completed at two visits, one year apart. Group differences were assessed with Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and the Holm–Bonferroni method; (3) Results: Individuals with persistent quantitative OD (n = 15) and self-reported parosmia (n = 19) showed statistically significant increases in BMI after 1 year (p = 0.004, adjusted α = 0.0125; p = 0.011, adjusted α = 0.0167).

doi:10.7717/peerj.14596,Performance of methods for SARS-CoV-2 variant detection and abundance estimation within mixed population samples,"Background The accurate identification of SARS-CoV-2 (SC2) variants and estimation of their abundance in mixed population samples (e.g., air or wastewater) is imperative for successful surveillance of community level trends. Assessing the performance of SC2 variant composition estimators (VCEs) should improve our confidence in public health decision making. Here, we introduce a linear regression based VCE and compare its performance to four other VCEs: two re-purposed DNA sequence read classifiers (Kallisto and Kraken2), a maximum-likelihood based method (Lineage deComposition for Sars-Cov-2 pooled samples (LCS)), and a regression based method (Freyja). Methods We simulated DNA sequence datasets of known variant composition from both Illumina and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) platforms and assessed the performance of each VCE. We also evaluated VCEs performance using publicly available empirical wastewater samples collected for SC2 surveillance efforts. Bioinformatic analyses were performed with a custom NextFlow workflow (C-WAP, CFSAN Wastewater Analysis Pipeline). Relative root mean squared error (RRMSE) was used as a measure of performance with respect to the known abundance and concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) was used to measure agreement between pairs of estimators. Results Based on our results from simulated data, Kallisto was the most accurate estimator as it had the lowest RRMSE, followed by Freyja. Kallisto and Freyja had the most similar predictions, reflected by the highest CCC metrics. We also found that accuracy was platform and amplicon panel dependent. For example, the accuracy of Freyja was significantly higher with Illumina data compared to ONT data; performance of Kallisto was best with ARTICv4. However, when analyzing empirical data there was poor agreement among methods and variations in the number of variants detected (e.g., Freyja ARTICv4 had a mean of 2.2 variants while Kallisto ARTICv4 had a mean of 10.1 variants). Conclusion This work provides an understanding of the differences in performance of a number of VCEs and how accurate they are in capturing the relative abundance of SC2 variants within a mixed sample (e.g., wastewater). Such information should help officials gauge the confidence they can have in such data for informing public health decisions.",PeerJ,2023,secondary,doi:10.7717/peerj.14596,36721781,9884472,https://doi.org/doi:10.7717/peerj.14596,

doi:10.1093/biomethods/bpad004,Automatic case cluster detection using hospital electronic health record data,"Abstract Case detection through contact tracing is a key intervention during an infectious disease outbreak. However, contact tracing is an intensive process where a given contact tracer must locate not only confirmed cases but also identify and interview known contacts. Often these data are manually recorded. During emerging outbreaks, the number of contacts could expand rapidly and beyond this, when focused on individual transmission chains, larger patterns may not be identified. Understanding if particular cases can be clustered and linked to a common source can help to prioritize contact tracing effects and understand underlying risk factors for large spreading events. Electronic health records systems are used by the vast majority of private healthcare systems across the USA, providing a potential way to automatically detect outbreaks and connect cases through already collected data. In this analysis, we propose an algorithm to identify case clusters within a community during an infectious disease outbreak using Bayesian probabilistic case linking and explore how this approach could supplement outbreak responses; especially when human contact tracing resources are limited.",Biology Methods & Protocols,2023,secondary,doi:10.1093/biomethods/bpad004,37016667,10067150,https://doi.org/doi:10.1093/biomethods/bpad004,

How glomerular maps relate to sensory space remains unclear. We sought to better characterize this relationship in the mouse olfactory system by defining glomeruli in terms of the odorants to which they are most sensitive. Using high-throughput odorant delivery and ultrasensitive imaging of sensory inputs, we imaged responses to 185 odorants presented at concentrations determined to activate only one or a few glomeruli across the dorsal olfactory bulb. The resulting datasets defined the tuning properties of glomeruli - and, by inference, their cognate odorant receptors - in a low-concentration regime, and yielded consensus maps of glomerular sensitivity across a wide range of chemical space. Glomeruli were extremely narrowly tuned, with ~25% responding to only one odorant, and extremely sensitive, responding to their effective odorants at sub-picomolar to nanomolar concentrations. Such narrow tuning in this concentration regime allowed for reliable functional identification of many glomeruli based on a single diagnostic odorant. At the same time, the response spectra of glomeruli responding to multiple odorants was best predicted by straightforward odorant structural features, and glomeruli sensitive to distinct odorants with common structural features were spatially clustered. These results define an underlying structure to the primary representation of sensory space by the mouse olfactory system.",eLife,2022,secondary,doi:10.1101/2022.05.11.491539,35861321,9352350,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2022.05.11.491539,

The purpose of this study is to compare the differences in the outbreaks of the different strains with regards to aspects such as epidemiological characteristics, transmissibility, and difficulties in prevention and control. Methods COVID-19 data from outbreaks of pre-Delta strains, the Delta variant and Omicron variant, were obtained from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Case data were collected from China's direct-reporting system, and the data concerning outbreaks were collected by on-site epidemiological investigators and collated by the authors of this paper. Indicators such as the effective reproduction number (Reff), time-dependent reproduction number (Rt), rate of decrease in transmissibility (RDT), and duration from the illness onset date to the diagnosed date (DID)/reported date (DIR) were used to compare differences in transmissibility between pre-Delta strains, Delta variants and Omicron variants. Non-parametric tests (namely the Kruskal-Wallis H and Mean-Whitney U tests) were used to compare differences in epidemiological characteristics and transmissibility between outbreaks of different strains. P < 0.05 indicated that the difference was statistically significant. Results Mainland China has maintained a “dynamic zero-out strategy” since the first case was reported, and clusters of outbreaks have occurred intermittently. The strains causing outbreaks in mainland China have gone through three stages: the outbreak of pre-Delta strains, the outbreak of the Delta variant, and outbreaks involving the superposition of Delta and Omicron variant strains. Each outbreak of pre-Delta strains went through two stages: a rising stage and a falling stage, Each outbreak of the Delta variant and Omicron variant went through three stages: a rising stage, a platform stage and a falling stage. The maximum Reff value of Omicron variant outbreaks was highest (median: 6.7; ranged from 5.3 to 8.0) and the differences were statistically significant. The RDT value of outbreaks involving pre-Delta strains was smallest (median: 91.4%; [IQR]: 87.30–94.27%), and the differences were statistically significant. The DID and DIR for all strains was mostly in a range of 0–2 days, with more than 75%. The range of duration for outbreaks of pre-Delta strains was the largest (median: 20 days, ranging from 1 to 61 days), and the differences were statistically significant. Conclusion With the evolution of the virus, the transmissibility of the variants has increased. The transmissibility of the Omicron variant is higher than that of both the pre-Delta strains and the Delta variant, and is more difficult to suppress. These findings provide us with get a more clear and precise picture of the transmissibility of the different variants in the real world, in accordance with the findings of previous studies. Reff is more suitable than Rt for assessing the transmissibility of the disease during an epidemic outbreak.",Frontiers in Public Health,2022,secondary,doi:10.3389/fpubh.2022.949594,36187650,9521362,https://doi.org/doi:10.3389/fpubh.2022.949594,

MPX was considered a rae and neglected disease, however the 2022 MPX outbreaks in multiple countries attracted attention of worldwide researchers to pace up for carrying out researches on various aspects of MPXV including attempts to design and develop diagnostics, vaccines, drugs and therapeutics counteract MPX. Apart from being a zoonotic disease, the current outbreaks highlighted rapid human-to-human transmission of MPXV, besides the reverse zoonosis has also been documented with recent first report of human-to-dog transmission, urging a call for the importance of one health approach. Atypical and unusual disease manifestations as well asymptomatic MPXV infections have also been observed during 2022 MPX outbreak. The affected patients typically develop a rash resulting in a mild disease followed by recovery with some supportive care and use of antivirals such as tecovirimat, cidofovir and brincidofovir in severe disease cases.

Wastewater samples were collected from 50 locations in London (August 2021–March 2022). Samples were tested for AAV using real‐time polymerase chain reaction followed by sequencing. Selected adenovirus (AdV)‐positive samples were also sequenced. The detection frequency of AAV2 was a sevenfold higher in 2022 samples compared with 2009–2013 samples (10% vs. 1.4%) and highest in AdV‐positive samples compared with negatives (10/37, 27% vs. 5/94, 5.3%, respectively). AAV2‐positive samples displayed high genetic diversity. AAV2 sequences were either very low or absent in wastewater collected in 2021 but increased in January 2022 and peaked in March 2022.

Continuing beyond the mutation escape of variants requires a specific, stable, point-of-care, modifiable, and low-cost therapeutic reagent for both prophylactic treatment and clinical treatment. The nucleic acid-based approach, aptamer, has become one of the most competitive candidates for this highdemand anti-covid treatment. As current substantial research has consolidated its optimistic biosensor role in the field of detection and diagnostics for Sars-Cov-2, it is undoubtedly worth exploring aptamers as neutralizing agents. The applicability of aptamers with refined advantages should not only allow more possibilities in screening and diagnosis but also confer promising capabilities in neutralization, chimeric therapy, delivery, and vaccines for COVID-19. Therefore, the paper, through the method of literature review, reveals the current state of coronavirus and aptamer, summarizes the recent developments in theranostic aptamers, anti-Sars-Cov-2 neutralizing aptamers, and combined aptamers, and the prospect of aptamer research, including its challenges and focus. The paper concludes that aptamer-based biosensors, rapid antigen tests, and treatments are promising priorities against COVID-19 as diagnostic-aimed and neutralizing-aimed aptamers have been developed during the past two years. Although RBD-targeted and multivalent aptamers partly dampen the burden of nonspecificity and low effectivity, pushing into the “in vivo” testing stage and tackling frequent mutation escape should be the future research focus.",,2023,secondary,doi:10.1117/12.2669355,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1117/12.2669355,

Despite progresses in clinical research, many puzzles about these diseases remain unanswered, and new therapies are continuously being sought. The evolution of bio-nanomedicine has enabled huge advancements in biosensing, diagnosis, bioimaging, and therapeutics. The recent development of aggregation-induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) has provided an impetus to the field of molecular bionanomaterials. Following aggregation, AIEgens show strong emission, overcoming the problems associated with the aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) effect. They also have other unique properties, including low background interferences, high signal-to-noise ratios, photostability, and excellent biocompatibility, along with activatable aggregation-enhanced theranostic effects, which help them achieve excellent therapeutic effects as an one-for-all multimodal theranostic platform.

The production of plant VNPs is simple and highly scalable through molecular farming in plants. Some of the important advances in VNP nanotechnology include genetic modification, disassembly/reassembly, and bioconjugation. Although effective, these methods often involve complex and time-consuming multi-step protocols. Here, we report a simple and versatile supramolecular coating strategy for designing functional plant VNPs via metal-phenolic networks (MPNs). Specifically, this method gives plant viruses [e.g., tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), cowpea mosaic virus, and potato virus X] additional functionalities including photothermal transduction, photoacoustic imaging, and fluorescent labeling via different components in MPN coating [i.e., complexes of tannic acid (TA), metal ions (e.g., Fe3+, Zr4+, or Gd3+), or fluorescent dyes (e.g., rhodamine 6G and thiazole orange)]. For example, using TMV as a viral substrate by choosing Zr4+-TA and rhodamine 6G, fluorescence is observed peaking at 555 nm; by choosing Fe3+-TA coating, the photothermal conversion efficiency was increased from 0.8 to 33.2%, and the photoacoustic performance was significantly improved with a limit of detection of 17.7 μg mL-1. We further confirmed that TMV@Fe3+-TA nanohybrids show good cytocompatibility and excellent cell-killing performance in photothermal therapy with 808 nm irradiation. These findings not only prove the practical benefits of this supramolecular coating for designing multifunctional and biocompatible plant VNPs but also bode well for using such materials in a variety of plant virus-based theranostic applications.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2022,secondary,doi:10.1021/acsami.1c22690,35258299,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1021/acsami.1c22690,

This difficulty is attributed to the vast datasets and inherent issues associated with classification. To overcome the limitations of existing alignment-centric and alignment-independent methods, a novel approach and software tool are required. In this research, we introduce ML-DSP, an innovative fusion of guided Machine Learning and processing of digital signals. This hybrid technique is developed to facilitate rapid, precise, and scalable classification of genetics across various taxonomic levels. The evaluation of ML-DSP involves the classification of 7396 complete mitochondrial genetics, resulting in an average accuracy of over 97% from kingdom to genus levels. Through a thorough comparison with classification software tools, using both small standard datasets and a larger dataset containing 4322 vertebrate mtDNA genetics, we demonstrate that machine learning digital signal processing beats the alignment-centric software MEGA7 (employing MUSCLE or CLUSTALW for alignment) into processing speed, during achieving kindred or even superior sorting accuracy across the data inventory. In contrast to the alignment-independent software FFP, Machine learning processing exhibits enhanced sorting accuracy and faster aggregate performance. Furthermore, starting experiments underscore the potential of ML-DSP in diverse datasets, achieving perfect accuracy in categorizing 4271 entire dengue virus genetic information into variants and 95.5% accuracy in classifying 4,710 bacterial genetic information into phyla.",2023 IEEE 3rd Mysore Sub Section International Conference (MysuruCon),2023,secondary,doi:10.1109/MysuruCon59703.2023.10396995,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1109/MysuruCon59703.2023.10396995,

doi:10.3389/fmedt.2021.694347,Up State of the SARS-COV-2 Spike Homotrimer Favors an Increased Virulence for New Variants,"The COVID-19 pandemic has spread worldwide. However, as soon as the first vaccines—the only scientifically verified and efficient therapeutic option thus far—were released, mutations combined into variants of SARS-CoV-2 that are more transmissible and virulent emerged, raising doubts about their efficiency. This study aims to explain possible molecular mechanisms responsible for the increased transmissibility and the increased rate of hospitalizations related to the new variants. A combination of theoretical methods was employed. Constant-pH Monte Carlo simulations were carried out to quantify the stability of several spike trimeric structures at different conformational states and the free energy of interactions between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) for the most worrying variants. Electrostatic epitopes were mapped using the PROCEEDpKa method. These analyses showed that the increased virulence is more likely to be due to the improved stability to the S trimer in the opened state, in which the virus can interact with the cellular receptor, ACE2, rather than due to alterations in the complexation RBD-ACE2, since the difference observed in the free energy values was small (although more attractive in general). Conversely, the South African/Beta variant (B.1.351), compared with the SARS-CoV-2 wild type (wt), is much more stable in the opened state with one or two RBDs in the up position than in the closed state with three RBDs in the down position favoring the infection. Such results contribute to understanding the natural history of disease and indicate possible strategies for developing new therapeutic molecules and adjusting the vaccine doses for higher B-cell antibody production.",Frontiers in Medical Technology,2021,secondary,doi:10.3389/fmedt.2021.694347,35047936,8757851,https://doi.org/doi:10.3389/fmedt.2021.694347,

These cells are characterized by differential expression of proteins and glycans, which serve as receptors during influenza virus infection. Attachment between these host receptors and the viral surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) initiates the influenza virus life cycle. However, the virus receptor binding specificities may not be static. Sialylated N-glycans are the most well-characterized receptors but are not essential for the entry of influenza viruses, and other molecules, such as O-glycans and non-sialylated glycans, may be involved in virus-cell attachment. Furthermore, correct cell polarity and directional trafficking of molecules are essential for the orderly development of the system and affect successful influenza infection; on the other hand, influenza infection can also change cell polarity.

They contaminate various crops and cause global food and feed safety concerns. Therefore, a simple, rapid, sensitive, and specific AFB1 detection tool is urgently needed. Aptamers generated by SELEX technology can specifically bind the desired targets with high affinity. The broad range of targets expands the scope of applications for aptamers. We used an AFB1-immobilized magnetic nanoparticle for SELEX to select AFB1-specific aptamers. One aptamer, fl−2CS1, revealed a dissociation constant (Kd = 2.5 μM) with AFB1 determined by isothermal titration calorimetry. Furthermore, no interaction was shown with other toxins (AFB2, AFG1, AFG2, OTA, and FB1). According to structural prediction and analysis, we identified a short version of the AFB1-specific aptamer, fl−2CS1/core, with a minimum length of 39-mer used in the AFB1-aptasensor system by real-time qPCR. The aptasensor showed a broad range of detection from 50 ppt to 50 ppb with an accuracy of 90% in the spiked peanut extract samples.

So far, with the notable exception of fecal microbiota transplantation in Clostridioides difficile infection, practical application of microbiome intervention has only achieved modest clinical effects. It is argued here that we need criteria for the link between microbiome and disease modelled on the links between pathogens and infectious disease in Koch’s postulates.

Because the pathophysiology of MIS-C remains unclear, a treatment strategy has not yet been established. We experienced a 12-year-old boy who developed MIS-C at 56 days after SARS-CoV-2 infection and for whom ciclosporin A (CsA) was effective as a third-line treatment. He had a high fever on day 1, and developed a rash on the trunk, swelling in the cervical region, and palmar erythema on day 2. On days 3, he developed conjunctivitis and lip redness, and fulfilled the criteria for classical Kawasaki disease (KD). Although intravenous immunoglobulin infusion (IVIG) was started on day 4, fever persisted and respiratory distress and severe abdominal pain developed. On day 5, because he fulfilled the criteria for MIS-C, methylprednisolone pulse was started for 3 days as a second-line treatment. However, he did not exhibit defervescence and the symptoms continued. Therefore, we selected CsA as a third-line treatment. CsA was so effective that he became defervescent and his symptoms disappeared. In order to clarify the relationship with treatment and the change of clinical conditions, we examined the kinetics of 71 serum cytokines to determine their relationships with his clinical course during the three successive treatments.

The potential spread of antimicrobial resistant bacteria and antimicrobial resistance genes (ARB/ARGs) from wastewater effluents through aerosolization is not fully understood. Septic tanks are on-site wastewater treatment systems (OWTS) used in about 25% of households in the United States (US). The system in this study consists of four tanks connected by two different treatment types, with wastewater moving from the most contaminated, Tank 1, to the most purified holding, Tank 4. Aerosol samples at each tank were collected in the summer and winter with open and closed lids to observe their effect on bioaerosol emissions. The water inside each tank was also sampled to compare the bacteria concentration and composition. Results from microbial and molecular analysis indicate lower concentrations of bacteria in the aerosols compared to the water samples. The antibiotic testing indicates that aerosolized bacteria from the winter were more resistant to the antibiotics used compared to the aerosolized bacteria from the summer. The occurrence of aerosolized bacteria likely depends on operational conditions and discharge methods, on changes in humidity, temperature, and air velocity, while the effluent resistance can be influenced by quorum sensing. Further assessment of the water and bioaerosol microbiome should include the genomic analysis of antimicrobial resistance of bacterial isolates from both sources and thus provide an important link regarding human exposure to ARBs/ARGs near wastewater treatment systems.

doi:10.1101/2023.06.13.544751,MultiNicheNet: a flexible framework for differential cell-cell communication analysis from multi-sample multi-condition single-cell transcriptomics data,"Dysregulated cell-cell communication is a hallmark of many disease phenotypes. Due to recent advances in single-cell transcriptomics and computational approaches, it is now possible to study intercellular communication on a genome- and tissue-wide scale. However, most current cell-cell communication inference tools have limitations when analyzing data from multiple samples and conditions. Their main limitation is that they do not address inter-sample heterogeneity adequately, which could lead to false inference. This issue is crucial for analyzing human cohort scRNA-seq datasets, complicating the comparison between healthy and diseased subjects. Therefore, we developed MultiNicheNet (https://github.com/saeyslab/multinichenetr), a novel framework to better analyze cell-cell communication from multi-sample multi-condition single-cell transcriptomics data. The main goals of MultiNicheNet are inferring the differentially expressed and active ligand-receptor pairs between conditions of interest and predicting the putative downstream target genes of these pairs. To achieve this goal, MultiNicheNet applies the principles of state-of-the-art differential expression algorithms for multi-sample scRNA-seq data. As a result, users can analyze differential cell-cell communication while adequately addressing inter-sample heterogeneity, handling complex multifactorial experimental designs, and correcting for batch effects and covariates. Moreover, MultiNicheNet uses NicheNet-v2, our new and substantially improved version of NicheNet’s ligand-receptor network and ligand-target prior knowledge model. We applied MultiNicheNet to patient cohort data of several diseases (breast cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, and lung fibrosis). For these diseases, MultiNicheNet uncovered known and novel aberrant cell-cell signaling processes. We also demonstrated MultiNicheNet’s potential to perform non-trivial analysis tasks, such as studying between- and within-group differences in cell-cell communication dynamics in response to therapy. As a final example, we used MulitNicheNet to elucidate dysregulated intercellular signaling in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis while correcting batch effects in integrated atlas data. Given the anticipated increase in multi-sample scRNA-seq datasets due to technological advancements and extensive atlas-building integration efforts, we expect that MultiNicheNet will be a valuable tool to uncover differences in cell-cell communication between healthy and diseased states.",bioRxiv,2023,secondary,doi:10.1101/2023.06.13.544751,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2023.06.13.544751,

ABSTRACT The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)/coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted an important role for efficient surveillance of microbial pathogens. High-throughput sequencing technologies provide valuable surveillance tools, offering opportunities to conduct high-resolution monitoring from diverse sample types, including from environmental sources. However, given their large size and potential to contain mixtures of lineages within samples, such genomic data sets can present challenges for analyzing the data and communicating results with diverse stakeholders. Here, we report MixviR, an R package for exploring, analyzing, and visualizing genomic data from potentially mixed samples of a target microbial group. MixviR characterizes variation at both the nucleotide and amino acid levels and offers the RShiny interactive dashboard for exploring data. We demonstrate MixviR’s utility with validation studies using mixtures of known lineages from both SARS-CoV-2 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis and with a case study analyzing lineages of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater samples over time at a sampling location in Ohio, USA.

An outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta AY.25 lineage associated with a university campus with multiple transmission events was identified; genomic analyses characterized this outbreak and complemented contract tracing and wastewater surveillance strategies that strengthened overall public health response actions. Epidemiologic and clinical data routinely gathered through contact tracing and public health investigations was matched to genomic sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 positive samples belonging to a suspect cluster identified through ongoing phylogenomic analyses. Continued phylogenetic analyses were conducted to describe the AY.25 outbreak. Wastewater collected twice weekly from sites across campus was tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR, and subsequently sequenced to identify variants. The AY.25 outbreak was defined by a single mutation (C18804T) and comprised 379 genomes from SARS-CoV-2 positive cases associated with the university and community. Several undergraduate student gatherings and congregate living settings on campus likely contributed to the rapid spread of COVID-19 across the university with secondary transmission into the community. The clade defining mutation was also found in wastewater samples collected from around student dormitories during ""move-in"", a week before the semester began, and 9 days before cases were identified. Genomic, epidemiologic, and wastewater surveillance provided evidence that an AY.25 clone was likely imported into the university setting just prior to the onset of the Fall 2021 semester, rapidly spread through a subset of the student population, and then subsequent spillover occurred in the surrounding community.

This testing was focused on minority communities and those who were disproportionately affected by the outbreak including individuals in high-risk jobs (e.g., as healthcare professionals and those at meatpacking warehouses or within other essential functions). Working the Envirome Institute’s Co-Immunity Project, “community testing insight” through randomized community testing, the only way to capture true incidence and prevalence rates. Randomized testing allowed for better understanding of how widespread COVID-19 was within Louisville. LMPHW’s COVID-19 Consultant commented that the Co-Immunity Project enabled LMPHW to make generalizations about the extent of virus spread considering both active positive cases and resolved cases. By partnering in the Co-Immunity Project, LMPHW gained access to scientific data and supplemental metrics to make more evidence-informed policy judgments. Additionally, the University of Louisville met with LMPHW leadership weekly to provide qualitative and quantitative data and research translation services that helped to guide the city’s decision-making processes. This activity later became the Wastewater-Informed Public Health Intervention Project.",Sustain Magazine,2022,secondary,doi:10.55504/2689-7296.1040,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.55504/2689-7296.1040,
doi:10.20517/jeea.2023.24,Considerations for conducting wastewater-based public health assessments in migrant populations,"Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) provides the ability to generate inclusive and comprehensive population-level health assessments of communities. Recent work suggests these inherent benefits of WBE can serve to support vulnerable communities worldwide, such as migrant populations. The topic of forced migration has gained significant attention in recent decades as conflict and climate change events have increasingly become major drivers of migration around the world. However, information on the health of displaced populations during times of active mobility is lacking due to several logistical and ethical challenges using conventional methods. As environmental, political, and humanitarian conditions continue to evolve, it appears necessary to pursue alternative and adaptable approaches to acquire the health status of such dynamic and vulnerable populations. Here, we propose a call to action to apply WBE in migrant populations to offer inclusive and minimally invasive health assessments in order to: (1) close data gaps in the health information of displaced populations actively traveling along migratory pathways; and (2) promote greater efficacy in deployed interventions. Suggestions to pursue urgent migrant-specific health priorities are proposed, including antimicrobial resistance (AMR), infectious diseases, and malnutrition, along with considerations to promote ethically sound investigation. Overall, these recommendations may serve as a foundation to support subsequent investigation, with the purpose of encouraging global collaboration to offer new insights into the health of migrant and/or forcibly displaced populations.",Journal of Environmental Exposure Assessment,2023,secondary,doi:10.20517/jeea.2023.24,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.20517/jeea.2023.24,
doi:10.1021/acsami.2c02405,A Folding-Based Electrochemical Aptasensor for the Single-Step Detection of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein,"Efficient and timely testing has taken center stage in the management, control, and monitoring of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Simple, rapid, cost-effective diagnostics are needed that can complement current polymerase chain reaction-based methods and lateral flow immunoassays. Here, we report the development of an electrochemical sensing platform based on single-walled carbon nanotube screen-printed electrodes (SWCNT-SPEs) functionalized with a redox-tagged DNA aptamer that specifically binds to the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 subunit. Single-step, reagentless detection of the S1 protein is achieved through a binding-induced, concentration-dependent folding of the DNA aptamer that reduces the efficiency of the electron transfer process between the redox tag and the electrode surface and causes a suppression of the resulting amperometric signal. This aptasensor is specific for the target S1 protein with a dissociation constant (KD) value of 43 ± 4 nM and a limit of detection of 7 nM. We demonstrate that the target S1 protein can be detected both in a buffer solution and in an artificial viral transport medium widely used for the collection of nasopharyngeal swabs, and that no cross-reactivity is observed in the presence of different, non-target viral proteins. We expect that this SWCNT-SPE-based format of electrochemical aptasensor will prove useful for the detection of other protein targets for which nucleic acid aptamer ligands are made available.",ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces,2022,secondary,doi:10.1021/acsami.2c02405,35446532,9045037,https://doi.org/doi:10.1021/acsami.2c02405,

Three papers used functional and structural studies to explore how mutations in the viral spike protein affect its ability to infect host cells and to evade host immunity. Gobeil et al. looked at a variant spike protein involved in transmission between minks and humans, as well as the B1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.351 (beta), and P1 (gamma) spike variants; Cai et al. focused on the alpha and beta variants; and McCallum et al. discuss the properties of the spike protein from the B1.1.427/B.1.429 (epsilon) variant. Together, these papers show a balance among mutations that enhance stability, those that increase binding to the human receptor ACE2, and those that confer resistance to neutralizing antibodies.

A novel variant of concern (VOC) named CAL.20C (B.1.427/B.1.429), which was originally detected in California, carries spike glycoprotein mutations S13I in the signal peptide, W152C in the N-terminal domain (NTD), and L452R in the receptor-binding domain (RBD). Plasma from individuals vaccinated with a Wuhan-1 isolate–based messenger RNA vaccine or from convalescent individuals exhibited neutralizing titers that were reduced 2- to 3.5-fold against the B.1.427/B.1.429 variant relative to wild-type pseudoviruses. The L452R mutation reduced neutralizing activity in 14 of 34 RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). The S13I and W152C mutations resulted in total loss of neutralization for 10 of 10 NTD-specific mAbs because the NTD antigenic supersite was remodeled by a shift of the signal peptide cleavage site and the formation of a new disulfide bond, as revealed by mass spectrometry and structural studies.","Science (New York, N.y.)",2021,secondary,doi:10.1126/science.abi7994,34210893,9835956,https://doi.org/doi:10.1126/science.abi7994,

SARS-CoV-2 is commonly spread from human to human through close contact and is capable of infecting both humans and animals. Worldwide, there have been over 675 animal outbreaks reported that resulted in over 2000 animal infections including domestic and wild animals. As the role of animal infections in the transmission, pathogenesis, and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is still unfolding, accurate and reliable animal diagnostic tests are critical to aid in managing both human and animal health. This review highlights key animal samples and the three main diagnostic approaches used for animal testing: PCR, serology, and Next Generation Sequencing. Diagnostic results help inform (often difficult) clinical decision-making, but also possible ways to mitigate spread among pets, food supplies, or wildlife. A One Health approach has been key to monitoring the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, as consistent human-animal interactions can lead to novel variants.

We have followed the time course of emerging viral mutants and variants during the SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic in ten countries on four continents. We examined > 383,500 complete SARS‐CoV‐2 nucleotide sequences in GISAID (Global Initiative of Sharing All Influenza Data) with sampling dates extending until April 05, 2021. These sequences originated from ten different countries: United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil, United States, India, Russia, France, Spain, Germany, and China. Among the 77 to 100 novel mutations, some previously reported mutations waned and some of them increased in prevalence over time.

CD results from dysregulation of the immune system related to genetic and environmental factors. While the use of monoclonal antibodies targeting cytokines and adhesion molecules has been shown to improve outcomes in CD patients, their widespread use has been limited due to high costs as well as variable access. Here, we summarize the factors that have been shown to correlate with responsiveness to biologic agents for use in practice. Areas covered We summarize the current literature regarding factors that have been shown to influence patient response to various biologic agents including: patient-related factors (e.g. age, gender, weight smoking history); disease-specific factors (e.g. disease duration, location/extension, behavior/phenotype, severity); genetic markers; transcription factors, and the gut microbiome. Finally, we review the utility of prediction models and present data supporting the use of recently developed decision support tools. Expert opinion Clinical decision support tools developed by machine learning are currently available for the selection of biologic agents in CD patients. We expect these models to become an integral tool for clinicians in the treatment of CD in the coming years.",Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy,2023,secondary,doi:10.1080/14712598.2023.2252339,37623370,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1080/14712598.2023.2252339,

Yet there are no generally accepted methods to consistently estimate the relative magnitude of the change in transmissiblity of newly emerging variants. In this paper we consider three methods for examining and quantifying positive selection of new and emerging strains of SARS-CoV-2 over an existing wild-type strain. We consider replication at the level of countries and allow for the action of other processes that can change variants' frequencies, specifically migration and drift. We apply these methods to the D614G spike mutation and the variant designated B.1.1.7, in every country where there is sufficient sequence data. For each of D614G and B.1.1.7, we find evidence for strong selection (greater than 25% increased contagiousness) in more than half of countries analyzed. Our results also shows that the selective advantages of these strains are highly heterogeneous at the country level, suggesting the need for a truly global perspective on the molecular epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2.",medRxiv,2021,secondary,doi:10.1101/2021.03.29.21254233,33821289,8020992,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2021.03.29.21254233,

Despite its highly controlled environment, characterised by microgravity, increased CO2 levels, and elevated solar radiation, microorganisms occupy a unique niche. These microbial inhabitants play a significant role in influencing the health and well-being of astronauts on board. One microorganism of particular interest in our study is Enterobacter bugandensis, primarily found in clinical specimens including the human gastrointestinal tract, and also reported to possess pathogenic traits, leading to a plethora of infections. Results Distinct from their Earth counterparts, ISS E. bugandensis strains have exhibited resistance mechanisms that categorize them within the ESKAPE pathogen group, a collection of pathogens recognized for their formidable resistance to antimicrobial treatments. During the two-year Microbial Tracking 1 mission, 12 strains of multidrug resistant E. bugandensis were isolated from various locations within the ISS. We have carried out a comprehensive study to understand the genomic intricacies of ISS-derived E. bugandensis in comparison to terrestrial strains, with a keen focus on those associated with clinical infections. We unravel the evolutionary trajectories of pivotal genes, especially those contributing to functional adaptations and potential antimicrobial resistance. A hypothesis central to our study was that the singular nature of the stresses of the space environment, distinct from any on Earth, could be driving these genomic adaptations. Extending our investigation, we meticulously mapped the prevalence and distribution of E. bugandensis across the ISS over time. This temporal analysis provided insights into the persistence, succession, and potential patterns of colonization of E. bugandensis in space. Furthermore, by leveraging advanced analytical techniques, including metabolic modelling, we delved into the coexisting microbial communities alongside E. bugandensis in the ISS across multiple missions and spatial locations. This exploration revealed intricate microbial interactions, offering a window into the microbial ecosystem dynamics within the ISS. Conclusions Our comprehensive analysis illuminated not only the ways these interactions sculpt microbial diversity but also the factors that might contribute to the potential dominance and succession of E. bugandensis within the ISS environment. The implications of these findings are two-fold. Firstly, they shed light on microbial behavior, adaptation, and evolution in extreme, isolated environments. Secondly, they underscore the need for robust preventive measures, ensuring the health and safety of astronauts by mitigating risks associated with potential pathogenic threats.",bioRxiv,2023,secondary,doi:10.1101/2023.09.05.556398,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2023.09.05.556398,

Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is a practical and cost-effective tool for the assessment and controlling of pandemics and probably for examining SARS-CoV-2 presence. Implementation of WBE during the outbreaks is not without limitations. Temperature, suspended solids, pH, and disinfectants affect the stability of viruses in wastewater. Due to these limitations, instruments and techniques have been utilized to detect SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in sewage using various concentration methods and computer-aided analyzes. RT-qPCR, ddRT-PCR, multiplex PCR, RT-LAMP, and electrochemical immunosensors have been employed to detect low levels of viral contamination. Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 is a crucial preventive measure against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To better assess the role of wastewater as a transmission route, detection, and quantification methods need to be refined.

Population biomarkers that measure the relative human fecal contribution to normalize SARS-CoV-2 wastewater concentrations are needed for improved analysis and interpretation of community infection trends. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Wastewater Surveillance System (CDC NWSS) recommends using the wastewater flow rate or human fecal indicators as population normalization factors. However, there is no consensus on which normalization factor performs best. In this study, we provided the first multistate assessment of the effects of flow rate and human fecal indicators (crAssphage, F+ Coliphage, and PMMoV) on the correlation of SARS-CoV-2 wastewater concentrations and COVID-19 cases using the CDC NWSS dataset of 182 communities across six U.S. states. Flow normalized SARS-CoV-2 wastewater concentrations produced the strongest correlation with COVID-19 cases. The correlation from the three human fecal indicators were significantly lower than flow rate. Additionally, using reverse transcription droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (RT-ddPCR) significantly improved correlation values over samples that were analyzed with real-time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (rRT-qPCR).

doi:10.1093/rheumatology/keac362,A rare onset in tumour necrosis factor receptor–associated periodic syndrome: recurrent macrophage activation syndrome triggered by COVID-19 infection,"DEAR EDITOR, Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a life-threatening cytokine storm syndrome that results from the activation of T lymphocytes and hemophagocytic macrophages [1]. It can occur in the course of infections, malignancy, autoimmune diseases and rheumatic diseases [2]. Among rheumatic diseases, MAS is most commonly seen in systemic JIA. It can also develop in SLE, Kawasaki disease and autoinflammatory diseases. Typical clinical and laboratory findings are sustained fever, rash, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, hyperferritinaemia, pancytopenia, fibrinolytic consumptive coagulopathy, hypertriglyceridaemia and liver dysfunction [2]. TNF receptor–associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) is an autosomal dominant autoinflammatory disease caused by mutations in the TNFRSF1A gene [3]. It is characterized by recurrent episodes of fever, rash, abdominal pain, periorbital oedema and arthralgia. MAS is rarely seen in TRAPS patients. Two cases have been reported in the literature. Herein we report a case of TRAPS presenting with MAS. A 6-year-old female patient was admitted with intermittent fever for the last month. She had non-consanguineous healthy parents. The child did not have any history of recurrent fever attacks. Since she had leucocyturia in the urine examination, intravenous antibiotics were started with the provisional diagnosis of pyelonephritis and urosepsis. Blood and urine cultures were sterile. Extensive viral serology tests were all negative. After 2 weeks of treatment, the fever continued and she was referred to our clinic with the provisional diagnosis of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), as she had a history of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection 4 months earlier. On physical examination there was no rash or joint findings suggestive of systemic JIA. Complete blood count showed anaemia (haemoglobin 8.8 g/dl) with normal leucocyte counts (5900/mm) without lymphopenia and normal platelet counts (205 000/mm). Acute phase reactants were mildly elevated [CRP 8.2 mg/l (normal 0–5), ESR 36 mm/h (normal 0–20)]. Urinalysis did not reveal any pyuria, haematuria or proteinuria. Other abnormal laboratory findings were hyperferritinaemia [ferritin 809 ng/ml (normal 13–150)], hypertriglyceridaemia [triglycerides 233 mg/dl (normal 0–150)] and aspartate aminotransferase was mildly elevated (58 U/l). A serum severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 IgG antibody test was positive. The child was diagnosed as having MIS-C [4]. IVIG (2 g/kg) and corticosteroid therapy (2 mg/kg/day) were started. Echocardiography was normal. On the third day of hospitalization, the fever continued, pancytopenia (haemoglobin 7.9 g/dl, leukocytes 2050/ mm, platelets 110 000/mm) developed and ferritin increased to 2400 ng/ml. She was admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Plasmapheresis was started. In the bone marrow aspiration, haemophagocytosis was observed and the culture was sterile. Genetic tests for familial haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and periodic fever syndromes (including MEFV, MVK, NLRP3, TNFRSF1A) were performed. Dexamethasone, ciclosporin and etoposide treatment were started according to the HLH 2004 protocol. After etoposide treatment, pancytopenia became more prominent (haemoglobin 7.9 g/dl, leucocytes 380/mm, platelets 37 000/mm). Ciclosporin and etoposide treatments were discontinued. Dexamethasone treatment was switched to pulse methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg/ day) and anakinra treatment was started. The fever regressed and cytopenia improved on the day 7 of anakinra. After 22 days of PICU follow-up, the patient was taken to the in-patient ward. During the follow-up, she did not have fever, and methylprednisolone treatment was gradually decreased. The patient was discharged with anakinra and methylprednisolone treatments. No mutation was detected in the STX11 and PRF1 genes. In the UNC13D gene, homozygous c.2599A>G (p.K867E) sequence variation was detected, which was classified as a benign variation in the databases. In the follow-up, the patient had two more MAS attacks that were controlled by increasing the doses of methylprednisolone and anakinra. In the autoinflammatory disease gene panel, a heterozygous c.236C>T p.(Thr79Met) (T50M) mutation was detected in the third exon of the TNFRSF1A gene. This mutation was classified as pathogenic in the databases and the child had the final diagnosis of TRAPS and anakinra treatment was continued. To the best of our knowledge, this is the third TRAPS case presenting with MAS. The first case of TRAPS and MAS reported in the literature was an 11-year-old girl who presented with MAS as the initial symptom [5]. In the follow-up of the patient, autoinflammatory disease was suspected due to ongoing recurrent fever attacks.

doi:10.1126/scitranslmed.abq1533,Core mitochondrial genes are down-regulated during SARS-CoV-2 infection of rodent and human hosts,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral proteins bind to host mitochondrial proteins, likely inhibiting oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and stimulating glycolysis. We analyzed mitochondrial gene expression in nasopharyngeal and autopsy tissues from patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In nasopharyngeal samples with declining viral titers, the virus blocked the transcription of a subset of nuclear DNA (nDNA)–encoded mitochondrial OXPHOS genes, induced the expression of microRNA 2392, activated HIF-1α to induce glycolysis, and activated host immune defenses including the integrated stress response. In autopsy tissues from patients with COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 was no longer present, and mitochondrial gene transcription had recovered in the lungs. However, nDNA mitochondrial gene expression remained suppressed in autopsy tissue from the heart and, to a lesser extent, kidney, and liver, whereas mitochondrial DNA transcription was induced and host-immune defense pathways were activated. During early SARS-CoV-2 infection of hamsters with peak lung viral load, mitochondrial gene expression in the lung was minimally perturbed but was down-regulated in the cerebellum and up-regulated in the striatum even though no SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the brain. During the mid-phase SARS-CoV-2 infection of mice, mitochondrial gene expression was starting to recover in mouse lungs. These data suggest that when the viral titer first peaks, there is a systemic host response followed by viral suppression of mitochondrial gene transcription and induction of glycolysis leading to the deployment of antiviral immune defenses. Even when the virus was cleared and lung mitochondrial function had recovered, mitochondrial function in the heart, kidney, liver, and lymph nodes remained impaired, potentially leading to severe COVID-19 pathology. Description COVID-19 pathology is associated with concerted inhibition of mitochondrial gene expression in mammalian hosts. Editor’s summary SARS-CoV-2 needs host cells to generate molecules for viral replication and propagation. Guarnieri et al. now show that the virus is able to block expression of both nuclear-encoded and mitochondrial-encoded mitochondrial genes, resulting in impaired host mitochondrial function. They analyzed human nasopharyngeal samples and autopsy tissues from patients with COVID-19 and tissues from hamsters and mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. Host cells attempt to compensate by activating innate immune defenses and mitochondrial gene expression, but chronically impaired mitochondrial function ultimately may result in serious COVID-19 sequelae such as organ failure. —Orla Smith",Science Translational Medicine,2023,secondary,doi:10.1126/scitranslmed.abq1533,37556555,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1126/scitranslmed.abq1533,

Severe acute hepatitis (SAH) is defined by a severe inflammation of hepatocytes in the liver parenchyma which can lead to an acute liver failure, a clinical condition with high mortality rate that can be triggered by several factors but is usually associated to hepatotropic viruses' infection. In 2022, cases of children with severe acute hepatitis of unknown origin hospitalized in Glasgow, Scotland, were reported. Possible causes of this condition include, but are not limited to, undiagnosed viral (and non-viral) infections, autoimmune hepatitis, drug and/or chemical toxicity, mitochondrial chain respiratory and metabolic disorders.


AREAS COVERED
Herpesviruses can cause severe acute hepatitis, but little is known about the role and the mechanisms of herpesviruses as a causative agent of this type of hepatitis. We review the role of herpesviruses as causative agent of SAH in children and other possible mechanisms involved in this disease.


EXPERT OPINION
Differential diagnosis for herpesvirus in SAH should be implemented in all settings. Alternative fluids, such as saliva and dried blood, could be used in the diagnosis to overwhelm the availability of biological specimens at sufficient volume. In the future, genetic studies could also be added to increase the knowledge about severe acute hepatitis in children.",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,2024,secondary,doi:10.1080/14787210.2024.2304637,38224018,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1080/14787210.2024.2304637,

A total of 484 patients participated (90.3%), age mean 37.2 ± 17.1 years, and 301 females (62.2%). Mild illness was the most common COVID-19 manifestation. After six months, 160 patients (33.1%) suffered at least one complication post-COVID-19, and 47 (29.4%) of them sought medical assistance. The most frequent persistent symptoms were hair loss, fatigue, loss of smell or taste, and headache. Risk factors associated with a complication were female sex (adjusted relative risk, [aRR] = 1.93 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.41–2.65), age 35 years and above (aRR = 1.50 95% CI 1.14–1.99), B blood group (aRR = 1.51 95% CI 1.04–2.16), current smoker (RR = 1.61 95% CI 1.02–2.54), and at least a COVID-19 exposure (aRR = 2.13 95% CI 1.11–4.09). Male sex, age younger than 35 years, and low COVID-19 exposures were associated with better recovery and return to usual health. A third of patients presented persistent symptoms compatible with the long-COVID-19 syndrome.

For example, large epistatic shifts in mutational effects caused by N501Y underlied the original emergence of Omicron variants, but whether such large epistatic saltations continue to define ongoing SARS-CoV-2 evolution remains unclear. We conducted deep mutational scans to measure the impacts of all single amino acid mutations and single-codon deletions in the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) on ACE2-binding affinity and protein expression in the recent Omicron BQ.1.1 and XBB.1.5 variants, and we compared mutational patterns to earlier viral strains that we have previously profiled. As with previous RBD deep mutational scans, we find many mutations that are tolerated or even enhance binding to ACE2 receptor. The tolerance of sites to single-codon deletion largely conforms with tolerance to amino acid mutation. Though deletions in the RBD have not yet been seen in dominant lineages, we observe many tolerated deletions including at positions that exhibit indel variation across broader sarbecovirus evolution and in emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of interest, most notably the well-tolerated Δ483 deletion in BA.2.86. The substitutions that distinguish recent viral variants have not induced as dramatic of epistatic perturbations as N501Y, but we identify ongoing epistatic drift in SARS-CoV-2 variants, including interaction between R493Q reversions and mutations at positions 453, 455, and 456, including mutations like F456L that define the newly emerging EG.5 lineage. Our results highlight ongoing drift in the effects of mutations due to epistasis, which may continue to direct SARS-CoV-2 evolution into new regions of sequence space.",PLOS Pathogens,2023,secondary,doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1011901,38157379,10783747,https://doi.org/doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1011901,

doi:10.1111/imr.13170,The neutrophil: A key resourceful agent in immune‐mediated vasculitis,"The term “vasculitis” refers to a group of rare immune‐mediated diseases characterized by the dysregulated immune system attacking blood vessels located in any organ of the body, including the skin, lungs, and kidneys. Vasculitides are classified according to the size of the vessel that is affected. Although this observation is not specific to small‐, medium‐, or large‐vessel vasculitides, patients show a high circulating neutrophil‐to‐lymphocyte ratio, suggesting the direct or indirect involvement of neutrophils in these diseases. As first responders to infection or inflammation, neutrophils release cytotoxic mediators, including reactive oxygen species, proteases, and neutrophil extracellular traps. If not controlled, this dangerous arsenal can injure the vascular system, which acts as the main transport route for neutrophils, thereby amplifying the initial inflammatory stimulus and the recruitment of immune cells. This review highlights the ability of neutrophils to “set the tone” for immune cells and other cells in the vessel wall. Considering both their long‐established and newly described roles, we extend their functions far beyond their direct host‐damaging potential. We also review the roles of neutrophils in various types of primary vasculitis, including immune complex vasculitis, anti‐neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody‐associated vasculitis, polyarteritis nodosa, Kawasaki disease, giant cell arteritis, Takayasu arteritis, and Behçet's disease.",Immunological Reviews,2022,secondary,doi:10.1111/imr.13170,36408947,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1111/imr.13170,

Therefore, direct analysis of residues in facemasks can be used to investigate the wearer's health and behavior. Here, we developed a simple paper-in-facemask sampling method for adsorbing a wearer's respiratory aerosol and environmental exposures by fixing paper strips at the outside and inside surfaces of facemasks, and the paper strips were then analyzed by paper spray mass spectrometry (PSMS) for directly detecting adsorbed analytes without any sample pretreatment. The applicability of this device was demonstrated by directly analyzing exhaled aerosolized saliva, breath metabolites, and inhalable environmental exposures. The technical aspects, including sampling time, sampling position, paper property, and spray solvent, were investigated. The sampling process was revealed to involve a continuous-flow adsorptive mechanism. These findings motivated us to extend this work and build a wearable sampling device that is capable of simultaneously monitoring both exhaled and inhaled biomarkers in situ to investigate human health and environmental exposure.

Aim: We investigated clinical characteristics and temporal distribution of acute hepatitis with unknown aetiology (AHUA) and of HAdV infections in Oxfordshire, UK population between 2016-2022. Methods: We used anonymised electronic health records (EHR) to collate retrospective data for presentations of AHUA and/or HAdV infection between 2016-2022. We reviewed records of >900,000 acute presentations to emergency care at Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (OUH; UK) and performed a descriptive analysis of case numbers and clinical characteristics. Results: Over the full study period, patients coded as AHUA had significantly higher critical care admission rates (p<0.0001, OR=41.7, 95% CI:26.3-65.0) and longer inpatient admissions (p<0.0001) compared with the rest of the patient population. Comparing events within the outbreak period (1st Oct 2021 - 31 Aug 2022), to those occurring outside this period, significantly more adults were diagnosed with AHUA (p<0.0001, OR=3.01, 95% CI: 2.20-4.12), and there were significantly more HAdV infections in children (p<0.001, OR=1.78, 95% CI:1.27-2.47). There were also more HAdV tests administered during the outbreak (p<0.0001, OR=1.27, 95% CI:1.17-1.37). There was no evidence of more acute hepatitis or increased severity of illness among patients who tested HAdV-positive compared to those testing HAdV-negative.

doi:10.1089/vim.2023.0074,Interaction Between Genetic Susceptibility and COVID-19 Pathogenesis in Pediatric Multisystem Inflammatory Disorders: The Role of Immune Responses.,"Numerous studies have highlighted the emergence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) symptoms reminiscent of Kawasaki disease in children, including fever, heightened multisystem inflammation, and multiorgan involvement, posing a life-threatening complication. Consequently, extensive research endeavors in pediatric have aimed to elucidate the intricate relationship between COVID-19 infection and the immune system. COVID-19 profoundly impacts immune cells, culminating in a cytokine storm that particularly inflicts damage on the pulmonary system. The gravity and vulnerability to COVID-19 are closely intertwined with the vigor of the immune response. In this context, the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecule assumes pivotal significance in shaping immune responses. Genetic scrutiny of HLA has unveiled the presence of at least one deleterious allele in children afflicted with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Furthermore, research has demonstrated that COVID-19 exploits the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor, transmembrane serine protease type 2, and various other genes to gain entry into host cells, with individuals harboring ACE-2 polymorphisms being at higher risk. Pediatric studies have employed diverse genetic methodologies, such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and whole exome sequencing, to scrutinize target genes. These investigations have pinpointed two specific genomic loci linked to the severity and susceptibility of COVID-19, with the HLA locus emerging as a notable risk factor. In this comprehensive review article, we endeavor to assess the available evidence and consolidate data, offering insights into current clinical practices and delineating avenues for future research. Our objective is to advance early diagnosis, stabilization, and appropriate management strategies to mitigate genetic susceptibility's impact on the incidence of COVID-19 in pediatric patients with multisystem inflammation.",Viral immunology,2024,secondary,doi:10.1089/vim.2023.0074,38271561,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1089/vim.2023.0074,

doi:10.3390/v14071398,Development and Primary Application of an Indirect ELISA Based on Rep Protein to Analyze Antibodies against Porcine Cocirvirus-like Virus (PCLV),"Porcine circovirus-like virus (PCLV) is a member of circovirus that contains a single-strand DNA genome, which may be one of the pathogens that causes diarrheal symptoms in pigs. The Rep protein encoded by the genome of PCLV may be responsible for viral genome replication. The development of serological detection methods for PCLV is of great necessity for clinical diagnosis, as well as epidemiological investigations. Therefore, this study attempted to build an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to examine antibodies against PCLV based on the His-tagged recombinant Rep protein. Full-length PCLV Rep protein was induced and expressed in E. coli and was purified as an antigen to establish an ELISA detection kit. The purified Rep protein was used to inject into mice to produce specific antibodies. There was no cross-reaction of Rep-based ELISA with antisera against other porcine viruses. The intra-assay and inter-assay coefficient variations (CVs) were 0.644–8.211% and 0.859–7.246%, respectively, indicating good repeatability. The non-cross-reaction with TGEV, PRRSV and PCV2 testing showed high sensitivity and high specificity for this ELISA assay. A total of 1593 serum samples collected from different pig farms in Jiangxi Province were tested for anti-PCLV Rep antibodies, and 284 (17.83%) of the 1593 samples were Rep antibody positive. Altogether, the indirect ELISA detection tool developed in this study could be applied to examine serum of PCLV antibodies with good repeatability, high sensitivity and high specificity. In addition, field sample detection results suggested that the PCLV antibody has a low prevalence in pig populations in Jiangxi Province of China.",Viruses,2022,secondary,doi:10.3390/v14071398,35891379,9317306,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/v14071398,

Acovimab also possesses strong synergistic neutralizing activity against some Omicron variants when combined with Sotrovimab. Polyclonal plasma antibodies from COVID-19 vaccinees who had recovered from SARS-CoV2 infection were shown to possess low neutralizing titers of antibodies against conserved RBD targets of CoV2 variants including XBB.1.5, which also synergistically neutralize with Sotrovimab against this variant. Summary The increasing prevalence of the highly antibody-evasive Omicron sublineages increases the risk of breakthrough infections and leaves high-risk and vulnerable immunocompromised individuals with no effective options for prophylactic or therapeutic antibody treatments. Here, we report a heavily mutated anti-RBD monoclonal antibody, Acovimab, directed against a site in the receptor-binding motif (RBM) region of the CoV2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), that possesses very broad and highly potent neutralizing activity against CoV2 variants, including many Omicron variants. This antibody is derived from the IGHV1-58*01 germline sequence and possesses a relatively high level of mutation (15.5% of the VH aa sequence), which is unusual for anti-RBD antibodies. Neutralizing activity was very potent (IC50s range of 1-9 ng/ml) for early Omicron subvariants that possess an unmutated F486 residue and is retained but less potent (IC50s of 200-650 ng/ml) for more resistant Omicron subvariants which contain the F486V mutation (BA4/5, BA4.6, and BQ1.1), but is lost for the later ultra-resistant variants that contain F486S (XBB) or F486P (XBB.1.5) mutations. Based on these specificities, it is predicted that Acovimab by itself should protect against CoV2 infections other than those caused by the XBB/XBB.1.5 family. Acovimab also shows strong synergy in neutralization when combined with Sotrovimab, which neutralizes all Omicron variants, including XBB.1.5. Plasma from subjects with hybrid immunity (induced by vaccination + infection) possessed low levels of XBB.1.5 RBM-targeting plasma-neutralizing antibodies, and these also neutralized synergistically when combined with Sotrovimab. These results suggest potentially novel immunotherapeutic options for treating most of the CoV2 variants responsible for current infections.",bioRxiv,2023,secondary,doi:10.1101/2023.05.04.539267,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2023.05.04.539267,

To characterize the impact of maternal nutrition and environmental factors on vaginally born infant gut microbiota composition, we performed an observational study in five distinct geographical areas in Vietnam. Fecal samples of infants (around 39 days old) and fecal and breast milk samples of their mothers (around 28 years) were collected. The microbiota composition of all samples was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene Illumina sequencing and a bioinformatics workflow based on QIIME. In addition, various breast milk components were determined. Strong associations between the geographically determined maternal diet and breast milk composition as well as infant fecal microbiota were revealed. Most notable was the association of urban Ha Noi with relatively high abundances of taxa considered pathobionts, such as Klebsiella and Citrobacter, at the expense of Bifidobacterium. Breast milk composition was most distinct in rural Ha Long Bay, characterized by higher concentrations of, e.g., docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), selenium, and vitamin B12, while it was characterized by, e.g., iron, zinc, and α-linolenic acid (ALA) in Ha Noi. Breast milk iron levels were positively associated with infant fecal Klebsiella and negatively with Bifidobacterium, while the EPA and DHA levels were positively associated with Bifidobacterium. In conclusion, differences between five regions in Vietnam with respect to both maternal breast milk and infant gut microbiota composition were revealed, most likely in part due to maternal nutrition. Thus, there could be opportunities to beneficially steer infant microbiota development in a more desired (rural instead of urban) direction through the mother’s diet.",Nutrients,2023,secondary,doi:10.3390/nu15224802,38004196,10675055,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/nu15224802,

In this regard, the transmission cycle of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from fecal, vomiting, and sputum routes to sewage has led health authorities to diagnose, prevent, and use novel wastewater treatment technologies. Once they enter the gastrointestinal canal of a healthy person, viral particles can infect via the nominal amount of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) present in alimentary canal cell surfaces and further infect lung, heart, kidney, and other organs. The current review highlights the detection, status, and fate of SARS-CoV-2 from sewage treatment facilities to water bodies. Besides, it addresses the potential wastewater treatment processes to cope with various viruses, especially SARS-CoV-2.

doi:10.1021/jacs.1c08898,An Activatable Near-Infrared Fluorescence Probe for in Vivo Imaging of Acute Kidney Injury by Targeting Phosphatidylserine and Caspase-3.,"Renal-clearable and target-responsive near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent imaging probes have been promising for in vivo diagnosis of acute kidney injury (AKI). However, designing an imaging probe that is renal-clearable and concurrently responsive toward multiple molecular targets to facilitate early detection of AKI with improved sensitivity and specificity is challenging. Herein, by leveraging the receptor-mediated binding and retention effect along with enzyme-triggered fluorescence activation, we design and synthesize an activatable small-molecule NIR fluorescent probe (1-DPA2) using a ""one-pot sequential click reaction"" approach. 1-DPA2 can target both the externalized phosphatidylserine (PS) and active caspase-3 (Casp-3), two essential biomarkers of apoptosis, producing enhanced 808 nm NIR fluorescence and a high signal-to-background ratio (SBR) amenable to detecting the onset of cisplatin-induced AKI in mice as early as 24 h post-treatment with cisplatin. We not only monitor the gradual activation of Casp-3 in the kidney of mice upon AKI progression but also can report on the progressive recovery of kidney functions in AKI mice following N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) therapy via real-time fluorescence imaging by 1-DPA2. This study demonstrates the ability of 1-DPA2 for longitudinal monitoring of renal cell apoptosis by concurrently targeting PS externalization and Casp-3 activation, which is efficient for early diagnosis of AKI and useful for prediction of potential drug nephrotoxicity as well as in vivo screening of anti-AKI drugs' efficacy.",Journal of the American Chemical Society,2021,secondary,doi:10.1021/jacs.1c08898,34672197,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1021/jacs.1c08898,
doi:10.1101/2023.02.15.23285942,Wastewater genomic surveillance tracks the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant across England,"Background Many countries have moved into a new stage of managing the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic with minimal restrictions and reduced testing in the population, leading to reduced genomic surveillance of virus variants in individuals. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) can provide an alternative means of tracking virus variants in the population but is lacking verifications of its comparability to individual testing data. Methods We analysed more than 19,000 samples from 524 wastewater sites across England at least twice a week between November 2021 and February 2022, capturing sewage from >70% of the English population. We used amplicon-based sequencing and the phylogeny based de-mixing tool Freyja to estimate SARS-CoV-2 variant frequencies and compared these to the variant dynamics observed in individual testing data from clinical and community settings. Findings We show that wastewater data can reconstruct the spread of the Omicron variant across England since November 2021 in close detail and aligns closely with epidemiological estimates from individual testing data. We also show the temporal and spatial spread of Omicron within London. Our wastewater data further reliably track the transition between Omicron subvariants BA1 and BA2 in February 2022 at regional and national levels. Interpretation Our demonstration that WBE can track the fast-paced dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 variant frequencies at a national scale and closely match individual testing data in time shows that WBE can reliably fill the monitoring gap left by reduced individual testing in a more affordable way.",,2023,secondary,doi:10.1101/2023.02.15.23285942,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2023.02.15.23285942,

The unprecedented pace of its transmission worldwide, and the resultant heavy burden on healthcare systems everywhere, prompted efforts to have effective therapeutic strategies and vaccination candidates available to the global population. While aged and immunocompromised individuals form a high-risk group for COVID-19 and have severe disease outcome, the rate of infections among children has also increased with the emergence of the Omicron variant. In addition, recent reports of threatening SARS-CoV-2-associated complications in children have brought to the forefront an urgent necessity for vaccination. In this article, we discuss the current scenario of SARS-CoV-2 infections in children with a special focus on the differences in their immune system response as compared to adults. Further, we describe the various available COVID-19 vaccines, including the recent bivalent vaccines for children, in detail, intending to increase willingness for their acceptance.",Vaccines,2023,secondary,doi:10.3390/vaccines11020418,36851295,9962844,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/vaccines11020418,

One such initiative involves wastewater-based epidemiology, which has gained attention for its potential to provide early warning of virus outbreaks and real-time information on its spread. In this study, wastewater samples from two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) located in the southeast of Spain (region of Murcia), namely Murcia, and Cartagena, were analyzed using RT-qPCR and high-throughput sequencing techniques to describe the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in the South-East of Spain. Additionally, phylogenetic analysis and machine learning approaches were applied to develop a pre-screening tool for the identification of differences among the variant composition of different wastewater samples. The results confirmed that the levels of SARS-CoV-2 in these wastewater samples changed concerning the number of SARS-CoV-2 cases detected in the population, and variant occurrences were in line with clinical reported data. The sequence analyses helped to describe how the different SARS-CoV-2 variants have been replaced over time. Additionally, the phylogenetic analysis showed that samples obtained at close sampling times exhibited a higher similarity than those obtained more distantly in time. A second analysis using a machine learning approach based on the mutations found in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was also conducted. Hierarchical clustering (HC) was used as an efficient unsupervised approach for data analysis. Results indicated that samples obtained in October 2022 in Murcia and Cartagena were significantly different, which corresponded well with the different virus variants circulating in the two locations. The proposed methods in this study are adequate for comparing consensus sequence types of the SARS-CoV-2 sequences as a preliminary evaluation of potential changes in the variants that are circulating in a given population at a specific time point.",Viruses,2023,secondary,doi:10.3390/v15071499,37515186,10386001,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/v15071499,

Augmenting these international endeavors with local initiatives becomes crucial to not only track the emergence of new variants but also to understand their spread. We present a cost-effective digital PCR-based pooled sample testing methodology tailored for early variant surveillance.Using 1200 retrospective SARS-CoV-2 positive samples, either negative or positive for Delta or Omicron, we assessed the sensitivity and specificity of our detection strategy employing commercial TaqMan variant probes in a 1:9 ratio of variant-positive to variant-negative samples.The study achieved 100% sensitivity and 99% specificity in 10-sample pools, with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) exceeding 0.998 in ROC curves, using distinct commercial TaqMan variant probes.The employment of two separate TaqMan probes for both Delta and Omicron establishes dual validation routes, emphasizing the method’s robustness. Although we used known samples to model realistic emergence scenarios of the Delta and Omicron variants, our main objective is to demonstrate the versatility of this strategy to identify future variant appearances. The utilization of two divergent variants and distinct probes for each confirms the method’s independence from specific variants and probes. This flexibility ensures it can be tailored to recognize any subsequent variant emergence, given the availability of its sequence and a specific probe. Consequently, our approach stands as a robust tool for tracking and managing any new variant outbreak, reinforcing our global readiness against possible future SARS-CoV-2 waves.",Frontiers in Public Health,2024,secondary,doi:10.3389/fpubh.2023.1340420,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.3389/fpubh.2023.1340420,

Since viral infections represent a potential triggering factor for the development of Kawasaki disease (KD), we examined the relationship between KD admission rates and the number of COVID-19, severe influenza, and severe enterovirus infections both before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study using data obtained from the Chang Gung Research Database (including seven Taiwanese hospitals and more than 10,000 beds) and the Centers for Disease Control in Taiwan from January 2018 to December 2020. We recorded the number of KD admissions, as well as COVID-19, severe influenza, and severe enterovirus infections. Results: The numbers of KD admissions, severe enterovirus infections, and severe influenza infections were significantly lower from April to September 2020. The number of KD hospitalizations was positively correlated with the number of domestic COVID-19 cases (p = 0.001). A decrease in KD admission numbers was positively correlated with a decrease in severe enterovirus case numbers (p = 0.007). Conclusion: Our findings provide further evidence that viral infections may be an important trigger factor in the development of KD.

A major way this has been accomplished is through the regular assessment of wastewater samples by qRT-PCR to detect the prevalence of viral nucleic acid with respect to time and location. Further expansion of SARS-CoV-2 wastewater monitoring efforts to include the detection of variants of interest / concern through next-generation sequencing have enhanced the understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. In this report we detail the results of a collaborative effort between public health and metropolitan wastewater management authorities and the University of Louisville to monitor the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic through the monitoring of aggregate wastewater samples over a period of 28 weeks. Our data indicates that wastewater monitoring of water quality treatment centers and smaller neighborhood-scale catchment areas is a viable means by which the prevalence and genetic variation of SARS-CoV-2 within a metropolitan community of approximately one million individuals may be monitored.

The most potent antibodies recognize exposed variable epitopes, often rendering them ineffective against other sarbecoviruses and SARS-CoV-2 variants. Class 4 anti-RBD antibodies against a less-exposed, but more-conserved, cryptic epitope could recognize newly-emergent zoonotic sarbecoviruses and variants, but usually show only weak neutralization potencies. We characterized two class 4 anti-RBD antibodies derived from COVID-19 donors that exhibited broad recognition and potent neutralization of zoonotic coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 variants. C118-RBD and C022-RBD structures revealed CDRH3 mainchain H-bond interactions that extended an RBD β-sheet, thus reducing sensitivity to RBD sidechain changes, and epitopes that extended from the cryptic epitope to occlude ACE2 binding. A C118-spike trimer structure revealed rotated RBDs to allow cryptic epitope access and the potential for intra-spike crosslinking to increase avidity.

Bacillus cereus, a foodborne pathogenic bacterium, has the potential to be a significant source of food contamination in such environments. This bacterium is a spore-forming bacteria that resists different antimicrobial treatments in cleanrooms where spacecraft are assembled. This study evaluated 41 B. cereus isolates from four pre-launch spacecraft in spacecraft assembly facilities for their toxin gene profile and antibiotic resistance. Four enterotoxin genes (hlbC, cytK, nheA, and entFM) and two emetic toxin genes (ces and CER) were targeted for chromosomal DNA and plasmid DNA. Results showed 31.7, 7.3, 85, and 41.5% of isolates contained hblC, cytK, nheA, and entFM, respectively, in chromosomal or plasmid DNA. Overall, 37 isolates (90.2%) showed at least one enterotoxin gene. The emetic toxin gene, ces, was detected in the plasmid DNA of three isolates (7.3%). The antibiotic resistance of isolates was evaluated by the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion procedure. All the isolates exhibited 100% susceptibility to gentamicin, 97% were susceptible to clindamycin, and 95% to chloramphenicol, imipenem, tetracycline, and vancomycin. The overall susceptibility average is 51%.

To help predict resistance to therapeutic antibodies in emerging variants, we profiled resistance patterns of 25 antibody products in late stages of clinical development against a large panel of variants that include single and multiple substitutions found in the spike protein. ABSTRACT Mutations in the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants can compromise the effectiveness of therapeutic antibodies. Most clinical-stage therapeutic antibodies target the spike receptor binding domain (RBD), but variants often have multiple mutations in several spike regions. To help predict antibody potency against emerging variants, we evaluated 25 clinical-stage therapeutic antibodies for neutralization activity against 60 pseudoviruses bearing spikes with single or multiple substitutions in several spike domains, including the full set of substitutions in B.1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.351 (beta), P.1 (gamma), B.1.429 (epsilon), B.1.526 (iota), A.23.1, and R.1 variants. We found that 14 of 15 single antibodies were vulnerable to at least one RBD substitution, but most combination and polyclonal therapeutic antibodies remained potent. Key substitutions in variants with multiple spike substitutions predicted resistance, but the degree of resistance could be modified in unpredictable ways by other spike substitutions that may reside outside the RBD. These findings highlight the importance of assessing antibody potency in the context of all substitutions in a variant and show that epistatic interactions in spike can modify virus susceptibility to therapeutic antibodies. IMPORTANCE Therapeutic antibodies are effective in preventing severe disease from SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19), but their effectiveness may be reduced by virus variants with mutations affecting the spike protein. To help predict resistance to therapeutic antibodies in emerging variants, we profiled resistance patterns of 25 antibody products in late stages of clinical development against a large panel of variants that include single and multiple substitutions found in the spike protein. We found that the presence of a key substitution in variants with multiple spike substitutions can predict resistance against a variant but that other substitutions can affect the degree of resistance in unpredictable ways.

Many health authorities around the world have implemented wastewater-based epidemiology as a rapid and complementary tool for the COVID-19 surveillance system and more recently for variants of concern emergence tracking. In this study, three SARS-CoV-2 target genes (N1, N2, and E) were quantified from wastewater influent samples (n = 250) obtained from the capital city and 7 other cities in various size in central Ohio from July 2020 to January 2021. To determine human-specific fecal strength in wastewater samples more accurately, two human fecal viruses (PMMoV and crAssphage) were quantified to normalize the SARS-CoV-2 gene concentrations in wastewater. To estimate the trend of new case numbers from SARS-CoV-2 gene levels, different statistical models were built and evaluated. From the longitudinal data, SARS-CoV-2 gene concentrations in wastewater strongly correlated with daily new confirmed COVID-19 cases (average Spearman r = 0.70, p < 0.05), with the N2 gene being the best predictor of the trend of confirmed cases. Moreover, average daily case numbers can help reduce the noise and variation from the clinical data. Among the models tested, the quadratic polynomial model performed best in correlating and predicting COVID-19 cases from the wastewater surveillance data, which can be used to track the effectiveness of vaccination in the later stage of the pandemic. Interestingly, neither of the normalization methods using PMMoV or crAssphage significantly enhanced the correlation with new case numbers, nor improved the estimation models. Whole-genome sequencing result showed that those detected SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern from the wastewater matched with the clinical isolates from the communities.

doi:10.1111/joim.13735,Does cardiovascular risk matter in IBD patients?,"Cardiovascular and thromboembolic risks are increasing in the population as a whole and therefore also in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. Obesity is a worldwide challenge also affecting the IBD population, and a causal association with Crohn's disease may exist. IBD itself, particularly when active, is also associated with a significant risk of thromboembolic and cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction and stroke. Cardiovascular risk is also a significant consideration when using Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors and sphingosine 1 phosphate (S1P) receptor modulators to treat IBD. JAK inhibitors – such as tofacitinib – are associated with several cardiovascular and venous thromboembolic risks, including hypertension and alterations in lipid profiles – specifically, increased LDL cholesterol and triglycerides – which may contribute to atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. S1P receptor modulators pose a slightly different set of cardiovascular risks. Initially, these drugs can cause transient bradycardia and atrioventricular (AV) block, leading to bradycardia. Moreover, they may induce QT interval prolongation, which increases the risk of life‐threatening arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. Some patients may also experience hypertension as a side effect. In this context, IBD healthcare providers need to be alert to the assessment of cardiovascular risk – particularly as cardiovascular events appear to be confined to specific patient groups with pre‐existing risk factors. In addition, the potential for S1P modulator drug interactions requires a higher level of vigilance in patients with polypharmacy compared to biologics.

Evidence suggests that the virus is evolving to allow efficient spread through the human population, including vaccinated individuals. Here we report a study of viral variants from surveillance of the Delaware Valley, including the city of Philadelphia, and variants infecting vaccinated subjects. We sequenced and analyzed complete viral genomes from 2621 surveillance samples from March 2020 to September 2021 and compared them to genome sequences from 159 vaccine breakthroughs. In the early spring of 2020, all detected variants were of the B.1 and closely related lineages. A mixture of lineages followed, notably including B.1.243 followed by B.1.1.7 (alpha), with other lineages present at lower levels. Later isolations were dominated by B.1.617.2 (delta) and other delta lineages; delta was the exclusive variant present by the last time sampled. To investigate whether any variants appeared preferentially in vaccine breakthroughs, we devised a model based on Bayesian autoregressive moving average logistic multinomial regression to allow rigorous comparison. This revealed that B.1.617.2 (delta) showed three-fold enrichment in vaccine breakthrough cases (odds ratio of 3; 95% credible interval 0.89-11). Viral point substitutions could also be associated with vaccine breakthroughs, notably the N501Y substitution found in the alpha, beta and gamma variants (odds ratio 2.04; 95% credible interval of 1.25-3.18).

We sought to study the outcomes following coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnosis in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD) in a single center in Brazil. Methods: Of the 522 patients on dialysis evaluated between March 1, 2020, and October 1, 2021, those presenting symptoms or with a history of close contact with COVID-19 patients were tested with reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction of samples from nasopharyngeal swabs. Results: Of the 522 patients, 120 were positive for COVID-19 infection, of which 86% were on HD and 14% in the PD program. The incidence per 10,000 inhabitants was higher in the HD group than in the PD group (2,423.5 vs. 1,752.5). The mortality per 10,000 inhabitants (470.5 vs. 927.8) and the fatality rate (19.4 vs. 52.9%, p = 0.005) were higher in the PD group. The PD group also had a higher need for hospitalization, intensive care, and mechanical ventilation. Conclusions: We advise caution when considering strategies to transfer patients from HD to the PD program to minimize the risk of COVID-19 for patients on HD.",Jornal Brasileiro de Nefrologia,2022,secondary,doi:10.1590/2175-8239-JBN-2021-0261en,35616362,9838679,https://doi.org/doi:10.1590/2175-8239-JBN-2021-0261en,

Children hospitalized with the diagnosis of COVID-19 or MIS-C at Meyer Children’s Hospital between February 2020 and June 2022 were retrospectively studied. One hundred twenty-two patients were enrolled, 95 in the COVID-19 group and 27 in the MIS-C group. In the COVID-19 group, impairment of consciousness was found in 67.4% of patients, headache in 18.9% and about 16.8% of patients experienced seizures. In this group, three patients were diagnosed with arterial ischemic stroke and one patient was diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). In the MIS-C group, about 70% of patients experienced consciousness impairment, about 20% behavioral changes, and another 20% mood deflection. Neurological symptoms and signs were highly heterogeneous and could be differentiated in COVID-19 and MIS-C. Consciousness impairment remained the most frequent manifestation in both groups, potentially underlying an encephalopathy. We also highlight the importance of considering psychiatric symptoms in children with COVID-19 and/or MIS-C.

Investigating the transcriptional changes in individuals affected by COVID-19 can help understand and predict the degree of illness and guide clinical outcomes in diverse backgrounds. Methods Analysis of host transcriptome variations via RNA sequencing from naso/oropharyngeal swabs of COVID-19 patients. Results We report strong upregulation of the innate immune response, especially type I interferon pathway, upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Upregulated genes were subjected to a comparative meta-analysis using global datasets to identify a common network of interferon stimulated and viral response genes that mediate the host response and resolution of infection. A large proportion of mis-regulated genes showed a reduction in expression level, suggesting an overall decrease in host mRNA production. Significantly downregulated genes included those encoding olfactory, taste and neuro-sensory receptors. Many pro-inflammatory markers and cytokines were also downregulated or remained unchanged in the COVID-19 patients. Finally, a large number of non-coding RNAs were identified as down-regulated, with a few of the lncRNAs associated with functional roles in directing the response to viral infection. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 infection results in the robust activation of the body’s innate immunity. Reduction of gene expression is well correlated with the clinical manifestations and symptoms of COVID-19 such as the loss of smell and taste, and myocardial and neurological complications.

Tailoring public health responses to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic depends on understanding the mechanism of viral replication, disease pathogenesis, accurately identifying acute infections, and mapping the spreading risk of hotspots across the globe. However, effective identification and isolation of persons with asymptomatic and mild SARS-CoV-2 infections remain the major obstacles to efforts in controlling the SARS-CoV-2 spread and hence the pandemic. Understanding the mechanism of persistent viral shedding, reinfection, and the post-acute sequalae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) is crucial in our efforts to combat the pandemic and provide better care and rehabilitation to survivors. Here, we present a living literature review (January 2020 through 15 March 2021) on SARS-CoV-2 viral persistence, reinfection, and PASC.

This is partly due to a lack of tools to effectively screen and triage individuals with potential TB. Whole blood RNA signatures have been extensively studied as potential biomarkers for TB, but they have failed to meet the World Health Organization's (WHOs) target product profiles (TPPs) for a non-sputum triage or diagnostic test. In this study, we investigated the utility of plasma cell-free RNA (cfRNA) as a host response biomarker for TB. We used RNA profiling by sequencing to analyze plasma samples from 182 individuals with a cough lasting at least two weeks, who were seen at outpatient clinics in Uganda, Vietnam, and the Philippines. Of these individuals, 100 were diagnosed with microbiologically-confirmed TB. Our analysis of the plasma cfRNA transcriptome revealed 541 differentially abundant genes, the top 150 of which were used to train 15 machine learning models. The highest performing model led to a 9-gene signature that had a diagnostic accuracy of 89.1% (95% CI: 83.6-93.4%) and an area under the curve of 0.934 (95% CI: 0.8674-1) for microbiologically-confirmed TB. This 9-gene signature exceeds the optimal WHO TPPs for a TB triage test (sensitivity: 96.2% [95% CI: 80.9-100%], specificity: 89.7% [95% CI: 72.4-100%]) and was robust to differences in sample collection, geographic location, and HIV status. Overall, our results demonstrate the utility of plasma cfRNA for the detection of TB and suggest the potential for a point-of-care, gene expression-based assay to aid in early detection of TB.",medRxiv,2023,secondary,doi:10.1101/2023.01.11.23284433,36711999,9882491,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2023.01.11.23284433,
doi:10.1128/mBio.01006-21,The SARS-CoV-2 Transcriptome and the Dynamics of the S Gene Furin Cleavage Site in Primary Human Airway Epithelia,"Polarized human airway epithelia at an air-liquid interface (HAE-ALI) are an in vitro model that supports efficient infection of SARS-CoV-2. The spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 contains a furin cleavage site (FCS) at the boundary of the S1 and S2 domains which distinguishes it from SARS-CoV. ABSTRACT The spike (S) polypeptide of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) consists of the S1 and S2 subunits and is processed by cellular proteases at the S1/S2 boundary that contains a furin cleavage site (FCS), 682RRAR↓S686. Various deletions surrounding the FCS have been identified in patients. When SARS-CoV-2 propagated in Vero cells, it acquired deletions surrounding the FCS. We studied the viral transcriptome in Vero cell-derived SARS-CoV-2-infected primary human airway epithelia (HAE) cultured at an air-liquid interface (ALI) with an emphasis on the viral genome stability of the FCS. While we found overall the viral transcriptome is similar to that generated from infected Vero cells, we identified a high percentage of mutated viral genome and transcripts in HAE-ALI. Two highly frequent deletions were found at the FCS region: a 12 amino acid deletion (678TNSPRRAR↓SVAS689) that contains the underlined FCS and a 5 amino acid deletion (675QTQTN679) that is two amino acids upstream of the FCS. Further studies on the dynamics of the FCS deletions in apically released virions from 11 infected HAE-ALI cultures of both healthy and lung disease donors revealed that the selective pressure for the FCS maintains the FCS stably in 9 HAE-ALI cultures but with 2 exceptions, in which the FCS deletions are retained at a high rate of >40% after infection of ≥13 days. Our study presents evidence for the role of unique properties of human airway epithelia in the dynamics of the FCS region during infection of human airways, which is likely donor dependent. IMPORTANCE Polarized human airway epithelia at an air-liquid interface (HAE-ALI) are an in vitro model that supports efficient infection of SARS-CoV-2. The spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 contains a furin cleavage site (FCS) at the boundary of the S1 and S2 domains which distinguishes it from SARS-CoV. However, FCS deletion mutants have been identified in patients and in vitro cell cultures, and how the airway epithelial cells maintain the unique FCS remains unknown. We found that HAE-ALI cultures were capable of suppressing two prevalent FCS deletion mutants (Δ678TNSPRRAR↓SVAS689 and Δ675QTQTN679) that were selected during propagation in Vero cells. While such suppression was observed in 9 out of 11 of the tested HAE-ALI cultures derived from independent donors, 2 exceptions that retained a high rate of FCS deletions were also found. Our results present evidence of the donor-dependent properties of human airway epithelia in the evolution of the FCS during infection.",mBio,2021,secondary,doi:10.1128/mBio.01006-21,33975939,8262919,https://doi.org/doi:10.1128/mBio.01006-21,
doi:10.3389/fimmu.2023.1157702,Alterations in immunophenotype and metabolic profile of mononuclear cells during follow up in children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C),"Introduction Although children seem to be less susceptible to COVID-19, some of them develop a rare but serious hyperinflammatory condition called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). While several studies describe the clinical conditions of acute MIS-C, the status of convalescent patients in the months after acute MIS-C is still unclear, especially the question of persistence of changes in the specific subpopulations of immune cells in the convalescent phase of the disease. Methods We therefore analyzed peripheral blood of 14 children with MIS-C at the onset of the disease (acute phase) and 2 to 6 months after disease onset (post-acute convalescent phase) for lymphocyte subsets and antigen-presenting cell (APC) phenotype. The results were compared with six healthy age-matched controls. Results All major lymphocyte populations (B cells, CD4 + and CD8+ T cells, and NK cells) were decreased in the acute phase and normalized in the convalescent phase. T cell activation was increased in the acute phase, followed by an increased proportion of γ/δ-double-negative T cells (γ/δ DN Ts) in the convalescent phase. B cell differentiation was impaired in the acute phase with a decreased proportion of CD21 expressing, activated/memory, and class-switched memory B cells, which normalized in the convalescent phase. The proportion of plasmacytoid dendritic cells, conventional type 2 dendritic cells, and classical monocytes were decreased, while the proportion of conventional type 1 dendritic cells was increased in the acute phase. Importantly the population of plasmacytoid dendritic cells remained decreased in the convalescent phase, while other APC populations normalized. Immunometabolic analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in the convalescent MIS-C showed comparable mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis rates to healthy controls. Conclusions While both immunophenotyping and immunometabolic analyzes showed that immune cells in the convalescent MIS-C phase normalized in many parameters, we found lower percentage of plasmablasts, lower expression of T cell co-receptors (CD3, CD4, and CD8), an increased percentage of γ/δ DN Ts and increased metabolic activity of CD3/CD28-stimulated T cells. Overall, the results suggest that inflammation persists for months after the onset of MIS-C, with significant alterations in some immune system parameters, which may also impair immune defense against viral infections.",Frontiers in Immunology,2023,secondary,doi:10.3389/fimmu.2023.1157702,37153551,10157053,https://doi.org/doi:10.3389/fimmu.2023.1157702,
doi:10.3390/diagnostics11112035,Increased Expression of Pyroptosis in Leukocytes of Patients with Kawasaki Disease,"Background: Kawasaki disease (KD) is a form of febrile vasculitis that primarily occurs in children. It can cause inflammation of the coronary arteries, which leads to aneurysms. The pathogenesis of coronary arteries may be associated with apoptosis or pyroptosis mediated by caspases activity, but this idea has not been discussed much in KD. Materials and Methods: We enrolled 236 participants in this study. In the Affymetrix GeneChip® Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 study, there were 18 KD patients analyzed prior to receiving intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment, at least 3 weeks after IVIG treatment, and 36 non-KD control subjects. We also recruited 24 KD patients prior to receiving IVIG treatment, at least 3 weeks after IVIG treatment, and 24 non-KD control subjects for Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip study. A separate cohort of 134 subjects was analyzed to validate real-time quantitative PCR. Results: The mRNA levels of caspase-1, -3, -4, and -5 were significantly increased in KD patients compared with control subjects (p < 0.05). After administration of IVIG, the expression of these genes decreased considerably. Of particular note, the methylation status of the CpG sites of the caspase-4 and -5 genes demonstrated significant opposite tendencies between the KD patients and controls. Furthermore, compared with patients who responded to IVIG, refractory KD patients had a lower expression of the caspase-3 gene prior to IVIG treatment. Conclusion: Our study is the first to report the upregulation of pyroptotic caspase-1, -4, and -5 in peripheral leukocytes of KD patients. Moreover, the expression of caspase-3 may be associated with IVIG resistance in KD.",Diagnostics,2021,secondary,doi:10.3390/diagnostics11112035,34829381,8620614,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/diagnostics11112035,
doi:10.3390/ijms241713130,Nano-Enabled Antivirals for Overcoming Antibody Escaped Mutations Based SARS-CoV-2 Waves,"This review discusses receptor-binding domain (RBD) mutations related to the emergence of various SARS-CoV-2 variants, which have been highlighted as a major cause of repetitive clinical waves of COVID-19. Our perusal of the literature reveals that most variants were able to escape neutralizing antibodies developed after immunization or natural exposure, pointing to the need for a sustainable technological solution to overcome this crisis. This review, therefore, focuses on nanotechnology and the development of antiviral nanomaterials with physical antagonistic features of viral replication checkpoints as such a solution. Our detailed discussion of SARS-CoV-2 replication and pathogenesis highlights four distinct checkpoints, the S protein (ACE2 receptor coupling), the RBD motif (ACE2 receptor coupling), ACE2 coupling, and the S protein cleavage site, as targets for the development of nano-enabled solutions that, for example, prevent viral attachment and fusion with the host cell by either blocking viral RBD/spike proteins or cellular ACE2 receptors. As proof of this concept, we highlight applications of several nanomaterials, such as metal and metal oxide nanoparticles, carbon-based nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, fullerene, carbon dots, quantum dots, polymeric nanoparticles, lipid-based, polymer-based, lipid–polymer hybrid-based, surface-modified nanoparticles that have already been employed to control viral infections. These nanoparticles were developed to inhibit receptor-mediated host–virus attachments and cell fusion, the uncoating of the virus, viral gene expression, protein synthesis, the assembly of progeny viral particles, and the release of the virion. Moreover, nanomaterials have been used as antiviral drug carriers and vaccines, and nano-enabled sensors have already been shown to enable fast, sensitive, and label-free real-time diagnosis of viral infections. Nano-biosensors could, therefore, also be useful in the remote testing and tracking of patients, while nanocarriers probed with target tissue could facilitate the targeted delivery of antiviral drugs to infected cells, tissues, organs, or systems while avoiding unwanted exposure of non-target tissues. Antiviral nanoparticles can also be applied to sanitizers, clothing, facemasks, and other personal protective equipment to minimize horizontal spread. We believe that the nanotechnology-enabled solutions described in this review will enable us to control repeated SAR-CoV-2 waves caused by antibody escape mutations.",International Journal of Molecular Sciences,2023,secondary,doi:10.3390/ijms241713130,37685938,10488153,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/ijms241713130,

The study of olfactory ability and its role in neurodegenerative diseases arouses much interest in the scientific community. In neurology, olfactory impairment is a potential early marker for the onset of neurodegenerative diseases, but the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. The loss of smell is considered a clinical sign of early-stage disease and a marker of the disease’s progression and cognitive impairment. Highlighting the importance of biological bases of smell and molecular pathways could be fundamental to improve neuroprotective and therapeutic strategies. We focused on the review articles and meta-analyses on olfactory and cognitive impairment. We depicted the neurobiology of olfaction and the most common olfactory tests in neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, we underlined the close relationship between the olfactory and cognitive deficit due to nasal neuroepithelium, which is a direct extension of the CNS in communication with the external environment.

In addition, it is possible that the knowledge of the relative abundance of bacteria and fungi during a treatment course or in pathological conditions can be relevant in many medical conditions. Here, we present a qPCR-targeted approach to determine the absolute and relative amounts of bacteria and fungi and demonstrate their relative DNA abundance in nine different human tissue types for a total of 87 samples. In these tissues, fungi genomes are more abundant in stool and skin samples but have much lower levels in other tissues. Bacteria genomes prevail in stool, skin, oral swabs, saliva, and gastric fluids. These findings were confirmed by shotgun sequencing for stool and gastric fluids. This approach may contribute to a more comprehensive view of the human microbiota in targeted studies for assessing the abundance levels of microorganisms during disease treatment/progression and to indicate the most informative methods for studying microbial composition (shotgun versus targeted sequencing) for various samples types.",Genes,2022,secondary,doi:10.3390/genes13020237,35205282,8872151,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/genes13020237,

The elderly also suffer from increased morbidity and mortality from seasonal influenza infections; thus, an annual influenza vaccination is recommended for them. In this study, we explore a possible county-level association between influenza vaccination coverage in people aged 65 years and older and the number of deaths from COVID-19. To this end, we used COVID-19 data up to 14 December 2020 and US population health data at the county level. We fit quasi-Poisson regression models using influenza vaccination coverage in the elderly population as the independent variable and the COVID-19 mortality rate as the outcome variable. We adjusted for an array of potential confounders using different propensity score regression methods. Results show that, on the county level, influenza vaccination coverage in the elderly population is negatively associated with mortality from COVID-19, using different methodologies for confounding adjustment.

Every day around the world, there are more than 150 million subway passengers. Since 2013, thousands of microbiome samples from various subways worldwide have been sequenced. Skin bacteria and environmental organisms dominate the subway microbiomes. The literature has revealed common bacterial groups in subway systems; even so, it is possible to identify cities by their microbiome. Low frequency bacteria are responsible for specific bacterial fingerprints of each subway system. Furthermore, daily subway commuters leave their microbial clouds and interact with other passengers. Microbial exchange is quite fast; the hand microbiome changes within minutes, and after cleaning the handrails, the bacteria are re‐established within minutes. To investigate new taxa and metabolic pathways of subway microbial communities, several high‐quality metagenomic‐assembled genomes (MAG) have been described. Subways are harsh environments unfavorable for microorganism growth. However, recent studies have observed a wide diversity of viable and metabolically active bacteria. Understanding which bacteria are living, dormant, or dead allows us to propose realistic ecological interactions. Questions regarding the relationship between humans and the subway microbiome, particularly the microbiome effects on personal and public health, remain unanswered.

Here we introduce slow5curl, a software package designed to streamline nanopore data sharing, accessibility and reanalysis. Slow5curl allows a user to fetch a specified read or group of reads from a raw nanopore dataset stored on a remote server, such as a public data repository, without downloading the entire file. Slow5curl uses an index to quickly fetch specific reads from a large dataset in SLOW5/BLOW5 format and highly parallelised data access requests to maximise download speeds. Using all public nanopore data from the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium (>22 TB), we demonstrate how slow5curl can be used to quickly fetch and reanalyse signal reads corresponding to a set of target genes from each individual in large cohort dataset (n = 91), minimising the time, egress costs, and local storage requirements for their reanalysis. We provide slow5curl as a free, open-source package that will reduce frictions in data sharing for the nanopore community: https://github.com/BonsonW/slow5curl",bioRxiv,2023,secondary,doi:10.1101/2023.11.28.569128,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2023.11.28.569128,
doi:10.2147/JIR.S331727,Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism LncRNA AC008392.1/rs7248320 in CARD8 is Associated with Kawasaki Disease Susceptibility in the Han Chinese Population,"Background Kawasaki disease (KD) is a multisystem vasculitis in infants and young children and involved in the NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation. Genetic factors may increase the risk of KD. To assess the association between rs7248320 in long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) AC008392.1 located in the upstream region of CARD8 and the risk of KD, a case–control study was conducted in the Han Chinese population. Methods This study genotyped the polymorphism rs7248320 in the lncRNA AC008392.1 gene using the TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction assay. The genetic contribution of rs7248320 was evaluated using odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using unconditional logistic regression analysis. The association between rs7248320 and KD susceptibility was analyzed by performing a hospital-based case–control study including 559 KD patients and 1055 non-KD controls. Results In this study, a significant relationship between rs7248320 and KD risk was observed in the genotype/allele frequency distribution. The rs7248320 polymorphism was associated with a significantly decreased risk of KD after adjustment for age and sex (AG vs AA: adjusted OR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.64–0.99, P = 0.0421; GG vs AA: adjusted OR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.51–1.00, P = 0.0492; AG/GG vs AA: adjusted OR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.63–0.96, P = 0.0186). Moreover, the rs7248320 G allele also exhibited a decreased risk for KD (adjusted OR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.72–0.97, P = 0.0193) compared with the A allele. In the stratification analysis, compared to the rs7248320 AA genotype, AG/GG genotypes were more protective for males (OR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.55–0.93, P = 0.0122). Conclusion This study suggests for the first time that the lncRNA AC008392.1 rs7248320 polymorphism may be involved in KD susceptibility in the Han Chinese population.",Journal of Inflammation Research,2021,secondary,doi:10.2147/JIR.S331727,34584439,8464376,https://doi.org/doi:10.2147/JIR.S331727,
doi:10.1101/2023.04.13.535896,SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen-specific B cell and antibody responses in pre-vaccination period COVID-19 convalescent males and females with or without post-covid condition,"Background Following SARS-CoV-2 infection a significant proportion of convalescent individuals develop the post-COVID condition (PCC) that is characterized by wide spectrum of symptoms encompassing various organs. Even though the underlying pathophysiology of PCC is not known, detection of viral transcripts and antigens in tissues other than lungs raise the possibility that PCC may be a consequence of aberrant immune response to the viral antigens. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated B cell and antibody responses to the SARS-CoV-2 antigens in PCC patients who experienced mild COVID-19 disease during the pre-vaccination period of COVID-19 pandemic. Methods The study subjects included unvaccinated male and female subjects who developed PCC or not (No-PCC) after clearing RT-PCR confirmed mild COVID-19 infection. SARS-CoV-2 D614G and omicron RBD specific B cell subsets in peripheral circulation were assessed by flow cytometry. IgG, IgG3 and IgA antibody titers toward RBD, spike and nucleocapsid antigens in the plasma were evaluated by ELISA. Results The frequency of the B cells specific to D614G-RBD were comparable in convalescent groups with and without PCC in both males and females. Notably, in females with PCC, the anti-D614G RBD specific double negative (IgD-CD27-) B cells showed significant correlation with the number of symptoms at acute of infection. Anti-spike antibody responses were also higher at 3 months post-infection in females who developed PCC, but not in the male PCC group. On the other hand, the male PCC group also showed consistently high anti-RBD IgG responses compared to all other groups. Conclusions The antibody responses to the spike protein, but not the RBD-specific B cell responses diverge between convalescent males and females, and those who develop PCC or not. Our findings suggest that sex-related factors may also be involved in the development of PCC via modulating antibody responses to the SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Short Summary Post-COVID Condition (PCC) is lingering illness that afflicts a significant proportion of COVID-19 patients from three months after clearing SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therapy for PCC is only palliative and the underlying disease mechanisms are unclear. The wide spectrum of PCC symptoms that can affect different organs and the detection of viral components in tissues distant from lungs raise the possibility that PCC may be associated with aberrant immune response due to presence of viral antigens. Therefore, we studied B cell and antibody responses to the spike and nucleoprotein antigens in PCC patients who cleared mild SARS-CoV-2 infection during the pre-vaccination COVID-19 pandemic period. We observed divergent patterns of immune reactivity to the spike protein in PCC males and females at different times post-infection, suggesting that the immune responses in PCC may also be influenced by sex-related factors.",Frontiers in Immunology,2023,secondary,doi:10.1101/2023.04.13.535896,37809081,10551145,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2023.04.13.535896,

In some cases, such as S gene target failure, the impact can serve as a unique indicator of a particular SARS-CoV-2 variant and provide a method for rapid detection. Here we describe partial ORF1ab gene target failure (pOGTF) on the cobas(R) SARS-CoV-2 assays, defined by a [≥]2 thermocycles delay in detection of the ORF1ab gene compared to the E gene. We demonstrate that pOGTF is 97% sensitive and 99% specific for SARS-CoV-2 lineage BA.2.12.1, an emerging variant in the United States with spike L452Q and S704L mutations that may impact transmission, infectivity, and/or immune evasion. Increasing rates of pOGTF closely mirrored rates of BA.2.12.1 sequences uploaded to public databases, and, importantly increasing local rates of pOGTF also mirrored increasing overall test positivity.

Although rare, there has been an increase in reports of myocarditis secondary to both individuals infected by the strain and those who received the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. The focus of this study is to determine the risk of myocarditis associated with the COVID-19 vaccine and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Relevant literature was collected using the search engines PubMed, Google Scholar, and the WHO Global Literature on Coronavirus Disease. Randomized controlled clinical trials and cohort studies reporting the risk of myocarditis induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccines were used. A meta-analysis was conducted using the inverse variance method using RevMan application software. A meta-analysis of the compiled data showed a mean risk ratio of 4.74 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.40 to 9.36; p < 0.0000100), which indicates there is a significant difference in the risk of COVID-19-induced myocarditis in those with unspecified vaccination status compared to the non-infected population. A meta-analysis of the selected data found a mean risk ratio of 5.01 (95% CI = 4.14 to 6.08; p < 0.0000100), indicating a significant difference in the risk of COVID-19-induced myocarditis between those who are unvaccinated and the non-infected population. Upon a meta-analysis of the selected data set, a mean risk ratio of 2.55 (95% CI = 0.840 to 7.74; p = 0.100) was found, indicating no significant difference in the risk of vaccine-induced myocarditis between those with a vaccinated vaccination status and that of the non-infected population. The result of this meta-analysis showed that infection with SARS-CoV-2 in unvaccinated patients carries a statistically significant increased risk of acquiring myocarditis while those receiving the vaccination do not share this same risk.",Cureus,2023,secondary,doi:10.7759/cureus.48059,38046477,10688762,https://doi.org/doi:10.7759/cureus.48059,

Here, aptamer-functionalized MXene nanosheet is demonstrated as a novel bionanosensor that detects COVID-19. Upon binding to the spike receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2, the aptamer probe is released from MXene surface restoring the quenched fluorescence. The performances of the fluorosensor are evaluated using antigen protein, cultured virus, and swab specimens from COVID-19 patients. It is evidenced that this sensor can detect SARS-CoV-2 spike protein at final concentration of 38.9 fg mL-1 and SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (limit of detection: 7.2 copies) within 30 min.

doi:10.3389/fped.2022.790273,Mechanisms of Immune Dysregulation in COVID-19 Are Different From SARS and MERS: A Perspective in Context of Kawasaki Disease and MIS-C,"Coronaviruses have led to three major outbreaks to date-Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS; 2002), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS; 2012) and the ongoing pandemic, Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19; 2019). Coronavirus infections are usually mild in children. However, a few children with MERS had presented with a severe phenotype in the acute phase resulting in progressive pneumonic changes with increasing oxygen dependency and acute respiratory distress requiring ventilatory support. A subset of children with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection develops a multisystem hyper-inflammatory phenotype known as Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C). This syndrome occurs 4-6 weeks after infection with SARS-CoV-2 and has been reported more often from areas with high community transmission. Children with MIS-C present with high fever and often have involvement of cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and hematologic systems leading to multiorgan failure. This is accompanied by elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-10. MIS-C has several similarities with Kawasaki disease (KD) considering children with both conditions present with fever, rash, conjunctival injection, mucosal symptoms and swelling of hands and feet. For reasons that are still not clear, both KD and MIS-C were not reported during the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV outbreaks. As SARS-CoV-2 differs from SARS-CoV by 19.5% and MERS by 50% in terms of sequence identity, differences in genomic and proteomic profiles may explain the varied disease immunopathology and host responses. Left untreated, MIS-C may lead to severe abdominal pain, ventricular dysfunction and shock. Immunological investigations reveal reduced numbers of follicular B cells, increased numbers of terminally differentiated CD4+T lymphocytes, and decreased IL-17A. There is still ambiguity about the clinical and immunologic risk factors that predispose some children to development of MIS-C while sparing others. Host-pathogen interactions in SARS, MERS and COVID-19 are likely to play a crucial role in the clinical phenotypes that manifest. This narrative review focuses on the immunological basis for development of MIS-C syndrome in the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. To the best of our knowledge, these aspects have not been reviewed before.",Frontiers in Pediatrics,2022,secondary,doi:10.3389/fped.2022.790273,35601440,9119432,https://doi.org/doi:10.3389/fped.2022.790273,

doi:10.1136/fmch-2023-002655,Liver abnormalities following SARS-CoV-2 infection in children 1 to 10 years of age.,"OBJECTIVE
Beginning in October 2021 in the USA and elsewhere, cases of severe paediatric hepatitis of unknown aetiology were identified in young children. While the adenovirus and adenovirus-associated virus have emerged as leading aetiological suspects, we attempted to investigate a potential role for SARS-CoV-2 in the development of subsequent liver abnormalities.


DESIGN
We conducted a study using retrospective cohorts of deidentified, aggregated data from the electronic health records of over 100 million patients contributed by US healthcare organisations.


RESULTS
Compared with propensity score matched children with other respiratory infections, children aged 1-10 years with COVID-19 had a higher risk of elevated transaminases (HR (95% CI) 2.16 (1.74 to 2.69)) or total bilirubin (HR (95% CI) 3.02 (1.91 to 4.78)), or new diagnoses of liver diseases (HR (95% CI) 1.67 (1.21 to 2.30)) from 1 to 6 months after infection. Patients with pre-existing liver abnormalities, liver abnormalities surrounding acute infection, younger age (1-4 years) or illness requiring hospitalisation all had similarly elevated risk. Children who developed liver abnormalities following COVID-19 had more pre-existing conditions than those who developed abnormalities following other infections.


CONCLUSION
These results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 may prime the patient for subsequent development of liver infections or non-infectious liver diseases. While rare (~1 in 1000), SARS-CoV-2 is a risk for subsequent abnormalities in liver function or the diagnosis of diseases of the liver.",Family medicine and community health,2024,secondary,doi:10.1136/fmch-2023-002655,38272541,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1136/fmch-2023-002655,
doi:10.3389/fneur.2022.821189,Uncovering Essential Tremor Genetics: The Promise of Long-Read Sequencing,"Long-read sequencing (LRS) technologies have been recently introduced to overcome intrinsic limitations of widely-used next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, namely the sequencing limited to short-read fragments (150–300 base pairs). Since its introduction, LRS has permitted many successes in unraveling hidden mutational mechanisms. One area in clinical neurology in need of rethinking as it applies to genetic mechanisms is essential tremor (ET). This disorder, among the most common in neurology, is a syndrome often exhibiting an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance whose large phenotypic spectrum suggest a multitude of genetic etiologies. Exome sequencing has revealed the genetic etiology only in rare ET families (FUS, SORT1, SCN4A, NOS3, KCNS2, HAPLN4/BRAL2, and USP46). We hypothesize that a reason for this shortcoming may be non-classical genetic mechanism(s) underpinning ET, among them trinucleotide, tetranucleotide, or pentanucleotide repeat disorders. In support of this hypothesis, trinucleotide (e.g., GGC repeats in NOTCH2NLC) and pentanucleotide repeat disorders (e.g., ATTTC repeats in STARD7) have been revealed as pathogenic in patients with a past history of what has come to be referred to as “ET plus,” bilateral hand tremor associated with epilepsy and/or leukoencephalopathy. A systematic review of LRS in neurodegenerative disorders showed that 10 of the 22 (45%) genetic etiologies ascertained by LRS include tremor in their phenotypic spectrum, suggesting that future clinical applications of LRS for tremor disorders may uncover genetic subtypes of familial ET that have eluded NGS, particularly those with associated leukoencephalopathy or family history of epilepsy. LRS provides a pathway for potentially uncovering novel genes and genetic mechanisms, helping narrow the large proportion of “idiopathic” ET.",Frontiers in Neurology,2022,secondary,doi:10.3389/fneur.2022.821189,35401394,8983820,https://doi.org/doi:10.3389/fneur.2022.821189,

However, there is limited information currently available on how NAFLD may affect the clinical course of IBD. Thus, we conducted a systematic review to evaluate the impact of NAFLD on IBD-related hospitalization outcomes. All observational studies assessing IBD-related hospitalization outcomes in patients with NAFLD were included. Exclusion criteria were studies published in languages other than English or French, or those involving pediatric population. Outcomes included IBD-related hospitalization and readmission rates, need for surgery, length of stay, inpatient mortality, and costs. Overall, 3252 citations were retrieved and seven studies met the inclusion criteria (1 574 937 patients); all were observational, of high quality, and originated in the United States. Measurable outcomes reported in these studies were few and with insufficient similarity across studies to complete a quantitative assessment. Only one study reports NAFLD severity. Two studies suggested a higher rate of hospitalization for patients with both NAFLD and IBD compared to IBD alone (incidence rate ratio of 1.54; 95% confidence interval: 1.33–1.79). This is the first systematic review to date that evaluates any possible association of NAFLD with IBD-related hospitalization outcomes. Despite the paucity and low quality of available data, our findings indicate that NAFLD may be associated with worse outcomes amongst IBD patients (especially Crohn’s disease).

Objectives: This study aimed to determine the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing hemodialysis referring to hemodialysis centers affiliated with the Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences between 2019 and 2021. Methods: This was a retrospective descriptive-analytical study with a sample size of 144 hemodialysis patients with COVID-19. The data were collected by a demographic questionnaire, a checklist based on the presence of underlying diseases, the cause of the kidney failure, drugs received during hemodialysis, medications used for COVID, the result of COVID-19 treatment, and outpatient or inpatient treatment, and the checklist of laboratory indices extracted from the patient’s medical records. Data were analyzed by SPSS version 20 and descriptive and analytical statistical tests. Results: The average age was 57.2 ± 14.42 years, and 64.6% were men, 35.4% were women, 64.6% recovered, and 35.4% died, although 42.4% of patients were treated on an outpatient basis, and 57.6% needed hospitalization. Also, 93.7% of patients were vaccinated. The average duration of hemodialysis treatment was 6.44 years, and diabetes accounted for 31.1% of the causes of kidney failure, and these people had a higher chance of mortality. Positive c-reactive protein (CRP) results were found in 72.2% of patients, and 54.2% had a positive erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). In addition, 22.2% of patients used mechanical ventilation, and 88.2% had positive PCR results. Iron, ferritin, albumin, and hemoglobin index were lower than normal in all patients. Patients with positive hepatitis B antigens were treated with sofosbuvir. In outpatient treatment, 65.6% used remdesivir, and 70.5% used dexamethasone. Regarding inpatient treatment, 75.9% used methylprednisolone, 56.6% used tocilizumab, and 54.2% used pirfenidone. Conclusions: The rate of death and hospitalization in hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 was higher than that of normal people. Diabetes increases the chance of morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 in hemodialysis patients. The reduction of hemoglobin, iron, ferritin, and albumin weakened the therapeutic response of hemodialysis patients to COVID-19 and increased the chance of death. Although various drugs were used in the treatment of COVID-19 hemodialysis patients, the patients did not follow a single regimen.",Jundishapur Journal of Chronic Disease Care,2023,secondary,doi:10.5812/jjcdc-135670,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.5812/jjcdc-135670,

In this study, we investigated the microbiome and virome present on the internal surfaces of a polar ship in different stages (beginning, during, and at the end) of the Brazilian Antarctic expedition in order to evaluate abundance of microorganisms in different periods. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS We used shotgun metagenomic analysis on pooled samples from sampling surfaces in the ship’s interior to track the microbial diversity. FINDINGS Considering the total fraction of the microbiome, the relative abundance of bacteria, eukaryotes, viruses, and archaea was 83.7%, 16.2%, 0.04%, and 0.002%, respectively. Proteobacteria was the most abundant bacterial phyla, followed by Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. Concerning the virome, the greatest richness of viral species was identified during the middle of the trip, including ten viral families after de novo assembly: Autographiviridae, Chrysoviridae, Genomoviridae, Herelleviridae, Myoviridae, Partitiviridae, Podoviridae, Potyviridae, Siphoviridae, and Virgaviridae.

The study of plasmids from sequencing data is challenging because short reads produce fragmented assemblies, requiring of subsequent discrimination between chromosome and plasmid sequences. Although circularized assemblies are now possible using long-read data, there is still a need to differentiate plasmids from other circular elements. Here, we present plaSquid, a dockerized tool developed in Nextflow that expands plasmid detection and improves replicon typing and mobility groups classification schemes, outperforming previously available methods in both precision and sensitivity. When applied to ∼10.5 million metagenomic contigs, plaSquid revealed a 2.7-fold increase in plasmid phylogenetic diversity. Also, we used plaSquid to uncover a significant role of plasmids in the widespread distribution of clinically-relevant antimicrobial resistance genes in the built environment, from cities to spacecraft.

In that capacity it has a major role in accelerating innovation and product development in engineering biology by implementing design, build, test and learn (DBTL) cycles. Biofoundries bring public and private stakeholders together to share resources, develop standards and forge collaborations on national and international levels. In this paper we argue for expanding the scope of applications for biofoundries towards roles in biosurveillance and biosecurity. Reviewing literature on these topics, we conclude that this could be achieved in multiple ways including developing measurement standards and protocols, engaging citizens in data collection, closer collaborations with biorefineries, and processing of samples.

The primary proteins in silks are often encoded by long, repetitive gene sequences. Until recently, sequencing and assembling these complex gene sequences has proven intractable given their repetitive structure. Here, using high-quality long-read sequencing, we show that there is extensive variation—both in terms of length and repeat motif order—between alleles of silk genes within individual arthropods. Further, this variation exists across two deep, independent origins of silk which diverged more than 500 million years ago—(1) the insect clade containing caddisflies and butterflies and (2) spiders. This remarkable convergence in previously overlooked patterns of allelic variation across multiple origins of silk suggests mechanisms for the generation and maintenance of structural protein-coding genes.

It also discusses how emerging and future variants could present a higher risk to children, including those with underlying comorbidities, in developing severe disease.

Whereas acute-COVID-19 severity and outcomes were previously correlated with Notch4 expression on Tregs, here, we show that Tregs in MIS-C were destabilized through a Notch1-dependent mechanism. Genetic analysis revealed that patients with MIS-C had enrichment of rare deleterious variants affecting inflammation and autoimmunity pathways, including dominant-negative mutations in the Notch1 regulators NUMB and NUMBL leading to Notch1 upregulation. Notch1 signaling in Tregs induced CD22, leading to their destabilization in a mTORC1-dependent manner and to the promotion of systemic inflammation. These results identify a Notch1/CD22 signaling axis that disrupts Treg function in MIS-C and point to distinct immune checkpoints controlled by individual Treg Notch receptors that shape the inflammatory outcome in SARS-CoV-2 infection.",The Journal of Clinical Investigation,2022,secondary,doi:10.1172/JCI163235,36282598,9797337,https://doi.org/doi:10.1172/JCI163235,

SARS-CoV-2 infection mostly occurs asymptomatically in the pediatric population, while multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) represents the most severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related illness, a life-threatening event with a high morbidity rate. After the development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and their subsequent approval in children, the rate of infection as well as the number of its related complications have shown a drastic decrease. Fully vaccinated children are protected from the risk of developing a severe disease and a similar protective role has been observed in the reduction of complications, in particular MIS-C. However, long-lasting immunity has not been demonstrated, booster doses have been required, and reinfection has been observed. With regards to vaccine safety, adverse events were generally mild to moderate in all age groups: local adverse events were the most commonly reported. Nevertheless, a potential association between SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and the subsequent development of inflammatory manifestations has been suggested. Myocarditis has rarely been observed following vaccination; it appeared to be more frequent among adolescent males with a mild clinical course leading to a complete recovery. SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-related MIS-C cases have been described, although a univocal definition and an exact time interval with respect to vaccination has not been reported, thus not establishing a direct causal link. Current evidence about COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents suggest that benefits outweigh potential risks.

However, challenges still exist for detection of SMMs due to their low concentration and complicated components in blood. In this work, we report the design of a novel ""selenium signature"" nanoprobe (Se nanoprobe) for efficient identification of multiple aldehyde metabolites in blood. This Se nanoprobe consists of magnetic nanoparticles that can enrich aldehyde metabolites from a complex environment, functionalized with photosensitive ""selenium signature"" hydrazide molecules that can react with aldehyde metabolites. Upon irradiation with UV, the aldehyde derivatives can be released from the Se nanoprobe and further sprayed by mass spectrometry through ambient ionization (AIMS).

While isothermal amplification techniques like LAMP eliminate the need for rapid temperature cycling in a portable format, these systems are still plagued by requirements for dedicated optical detection apparatus for analysis and manual off-chip sample processing. Here, we developed a new microfluidic system for LAMP-based POC NAATs to address these limitations. The new system combines digital microfluidics (DMF) with distance-based detection (DBD) for direct signal readout. This is the first report of the use of (i) LAMP or (ii) DMF with DBD - thus, we describe a number of characterization steps taken to determine optimal combinations of reagents, materials, and processes for reliable operation. For example, DBD was found to be quite sensitive to background signals from low molecular weight LAMP products; thus, a Capto™ adhere bead-based clean-up procedure was developed to isolate the desirable high-molecular-weight products for analysis. The new method was validated by application to detection of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva. The method was able to distinguish between saliva containing no virus, saliva containing a low viral load (104 genome copies per mL), and saliva containing a high viral load (108 copies per mL), all in an automated system that does not require detection apparatus for analysis. We propose that the combination of DMF with distance-based detection may be a powerful one for implementing a variety of POC NAATs or for other applications in the future.",Lab on a chip,2023,secondary,doi:10.1039/d3lc00683b,37987330,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1039/d3lc00683b,

However, it remains a challenge to incorporate biocompatible natural polymers that are favorable for practical biomedical applications. In this work, bilayer magnetic microrobots with an achiral planar design were fabricated using a biocompatible natural polymer and Fe3O4 nanoparticles through the photolithography by applying the layer-by-layer method. The microrobots consisted of a magnetic bottom layer and a photo-crosslinked chitosan top layer. The SEM results showed that the microrobot processed the L-shaped planar structure with the average width, length, and thickness of 99.18 ± 5.11 μm, 189.56 ± 11.37 μm, and 23.56 ± 4.08 μm, respectively.

Herein, a peptide‐derived supramolecular self‐assembly system is reported for ultrasensitive and visual detection of LMWH. Two different peptides are designed and modified by gold nanocluster (AuNC) and tetraphenylethene (TPE), respectively, to co‐assemble into nanoparticles, enabling the loading and co‐recognition of LMWH. Owing to two‐wavelength emission from the co‐assemblies at 624 and 460 nm that is highly sensitive to LMWH, such assemblies realize ratio‐type detection of LMWH. The sensitivity of the AuNC‐peptide to LMWH significantly increases when co‐assembling with TPE‐peptide, while that of TPE‐peptide maintains in a high level, enabling a balanced and ultrahigh sensitivity of both two fluorophores. Such self‐assemblies reach an extreme limit of detection of 0.0004 IU mL−1 and realize dramatic fluorescence color change when loading trace concentration of LMWH, which can be simply distinguished by naked‐eye. Thus, by preparing Pep2@AuNC/TPE‐Pep1 test strips the POC testing of LMWH in real thrombus patient samples has achieved.

doi:10.3389/fsysb.2022.910243,Leveraging Systems Immunology to Optimize Diagnosis and Treatment of Inborn Errors of Immunity,"Inborn errors of immunity (IEI) are monogenic disorders that can cause diverse symptoms, including recurrent infections, autoimmunity and malignancy. While many factors have contributed, the increased availability of next-generation sequencing has been central in the remarkable increase in identification of novel monogenic IEI over the past years. Throughout this phase of disease discovery, it has also become evident that a given gene variant does not always yield a consistent phenotype, while variants in seemingly disparate genes can lead to similar clinical presentations. Thus, it is increasingly clear that the clinical phenotype of an IEI patient is not defined by genetics alone, but is also impacted by a myriad of factors. Accordingly, we need methods to amplify our current diagnostic algorithms to better understand mechanisms underlying the variability in our patients and to optimize treatment. In this review, we will explore how systems immunology can contribute to optimizing both diagnosis and treatment of IEI patients by focusing on identifying and quantifying key dysregulated pathways. To improve mechanistic understanding in IEI we must deeply evaluate our rare IEI patients using multimodal strategies, allowing both the quantification of altered immune cell subsets and their functional evaluation. By studying representative controls and patients, we can identify causative pathways underlying immune cell dysfunction and move towards functional diagnosis. Attaining this deeper understanding of IEI will require a stepwise strategy. First, we need to broadly apply these methods to IEI patients to identify patterns of dysfunction. Next, using multimodal data analysis, we can identify key dysregulated pathways. Then, we must develop a core group of simple, effective functional tests that target those pathways to increase efficiency of initial diagnostic investigations, provide evidence for therapeutic selection and contribute to the mechanistic evaluation of genetic results. This core group of simple, effective functional tests, targeting key pathways, can then be equitably provided to our rare patients. Systems biology is thus poised to reframe IEI diagnosis and therapy, fostering research today that will provide streamlined diagnosis and treatment choices for our rare and complex patients in the future, as well as providing a better understanding of basic immunology.",Frontiers in systems biology,2022,secondary,doi:10.3389/fsysb.2022.910243,37670772,10477056,https://doi.org/doi:10.3389/fsysb.2022.910243,

The power and potential of this platform technology were rapidly realized when it became evident that not only did WBS-measured SARS-CoV-2 RNA correlate strongly with COVID-19 clinical disease within monitored populations but also, in fact, it functioned as a leading indicator. Teams from across the globe rapidly innovated novel approaches by which wastewater could be collected from diverse sewersheds ranging from wastewater treatment plants (enabling community-level surveillance) to more granular locations including individual neighborhoods and high-risk buildings such as long-term care facilities (LTCF). Efficient processes enabled SARS-CoV-2 RNA extraction and concentration from the highly dilute wastewater matrix. Molecular and genomic tools to identify, quantify, and characterize SARS-CoV-2 and its various variants were adapted from clinical programs and applied to these mixed environmental systems. Novel data-sharing tools allowed this information to be mobilized and made immediately available to public health and government decision-makers and even the public, enabling evidence-informed decision-making based on local disease dynamics. WBS has since been recognized as a tool of transformative potential, providing near-real-time cost-effective, objective, comprehensive, and inclusive data on the changing prevalence of measured analytes across space and time in populations. However, as a consequence of rapid innovation from hundreds of teams simultaneously, tremendous heterogeneity currently exists in the SARS-CoV-2 WBS literature. This manuscript provides a state-of-the-art review of WBS as established with SARS-CoV-2 and details the current work underway expanding its scope to other infectious disease targets.",Clinical Microbiology Reviews,2023,secondary,doi:10.1128/cmr.00103-22,38095438,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1128/cmr.00103-22,

Herein, we propose a hybridization chain reaction (HCR)-mediated multisite exonuclease III (Exo-III) amplification strategy (HCR/Exo-III amplifier) to achieve the one-pot and ultrasensitive isothermal amplification of bacterial 16S rRNA and a portable fluorescence detection device (PFD) to directly read signals in a lateral flow assay (LFA). In detail, the target-initiated HCR products present multiple binding sites for triggering the Exo-III amplifier that produces numerous target amplicons. Following that, the target amplicons travel up on the strip and bridge between the DNA-CdTe/CdS probes and the capture DNA to form a positive fluorescence line. After that, the strip is inserted into the PFD to accomplish the fluorescence signal reading. The constructed HCR/Exo-III amplifier-based PFD-LFA implemented the simultaneous and specific detection of three bacteria with a detection limit of a few tenths of fM for synthetic 16S rRNA fragments and dozens of CFU/mL for Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella typhimurium in pure cultures. The sensing platform features isothermal amplification, convenient operation, and good economy, displaying great potential for on-site testing toward multiple nucleic acid analytes.",Analytical chemistry,2023,secondary,doi:10.1021/acs.analchem.3c00270,36946074,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1021/acs.analchem.3c00270,

However, their transmission dynamics are poorly characterised. The epidemic situation in Chile enables us to investigate differences in the distribution and spread of variants Alpha, Gamma, Lambda, Mu and Delta. Chile implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions and an integrated genomic and epidemiological surveillance system that included airport and community surveillance to track SARS-CoV-2 variants. Here we combine viral genomic data and anonymised human mobility data from mobile phones to characterise the routes of importation of different variants into Chile, the relative contributions of airport-based importations to viral diversity versus land border crossings and test the impact of the mobility network on the diffusion of viral lineages within the country. We find that Alpha, Lambda and Mu were identified in Chile via airport surveillance six, four and five weeks ahead of their detection via community surveillance, respectively. Further, some variants that originated in South America were imported into Chile via land rather than international air travel, most notably Gamma. Different variants exhibited similar trends of viral dissemination throughout the country following their importation, and we show that the mobility network predicts the time of arrival of imported lineages to different Chilean comunas. Higher stringency of local NPIs was also associated with fewer domestic viral importations. Our results show how genomic surveillance combined with high resolution mobility data can help predict the multi-scale geographic expansion of emerging infectious diseases.",,2024,secondary,doi:10.1101/2024.01.18.24301504,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2024.01.18.24301504,

Despite research, there are still controversial areas in the management of Crohn's disease (CD).


OBJECTIVE
To establish practical recommendations on using anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) drugs in patients with moderate-to-severe CD.


METHODS
Clinical controversies in the management of CD using anti-TNF therapies were identified. A comprehensive literature review was performed, and a national survey was launched to examine current clinical practices when using anti-TNF therapies. Their results were discussed by expert gastroenterologists within a nominal group meeting, and a set of statements was proposed and tested in a Delphi process.


RESULTS
Qualitative study. The survey and Delphi process were sent to 244 CD-treating physicians (response rate: 58%). A total of 14 statements were generated. All but two achieved agreement. These statements cover: (1) use of first-line non-anti-TNF biological therapy; (2) role of HLA-DQA1*05 in daily practice; (3) attitudes in primary non-response and loss of response to anti-TNF therapy due to immunogenicity; (4) use of ustekinumab or vedolizumab if a change in action mechanism is warranted; (5) anti-TNF drug level monitoring; (6) combined therapy with an immunomodulator.


CONCLUSION
This document sought to pull together the best evidence, experts' opinions, and treating physicians' attitudes when using anti-TNF therapies in patients with CD.",BMJ open gastroenterology,2024,secondary,doi:10.1136/bmjgast-2023-001246,38267072,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1136/bmjgast-2023-001246,

This was a prospective and observational study including patients with RRMS with active and inactive disease and healthy controls. Blood EVs were isolated by precipitation. Titers of antibodies against nuclear (anti-EBNA1) and capsid (anti-VCA) EBV antigens in EVs and in plasma, as well as content of myelin antibodies in EVs were determined by ELISA. An exploratory analysis of correlations with clinical and radiological data was performed. Patients with RRMS had higher titers of anti-VCA inside EVs and free in plasma than healthy controls. Patients with active disease showed higher levels of anti-EBNA1 in EVs, but not in plasma, than patients with inactive disease. EV anti-VCA levels correlated with disease duration and with decreased brain volume structures—total brain, white matter, gray matter, cerebellum, hippocampus, —but not with T2/FLAIR lesion volume or EDSS, SDMT, or 9HPT. In addition, EV anti-VCA correlated with EV anti-MBP.

Here we describe expanding the chemistry for the Digital Spatial Profiling platform to quantify whole transcriptomes in human and mouse tissues using a wide range of spatial profiling strategies and sample types. We designed multiplexed in situ hybridization probe pools targeting the protein-coding genes in the human and mouse transcriptomes, hereafter referred to as the human or mouse Whole Transcriptome Atlas (WTA). We validated the human and mouse WTA using cell lines to demonstrate concordance with orthogonal gene expression profiling methods in profiled region sizes ranging from ~10-500 cells. By benchmarking against bulk RNAseq and fluorescence in situ hybridization, we demonstrate robust transcript detection possible down to ~100 transcripts per region. To assess the performance of WTA across tissue and sample types, we applied WTA to biological questions in cancer, molecular pathology, and developmental biology. We show that spatial profiling with WTA can detect expected spatial gene expression differences between tumor and tumor microenvironment, identify spatial disease-specific heterogeneity in gene expression in histological structures of the human kidney, and comprehensively map transcriptional programs in anatomical substructures of nine organs in the developing mouse embryo.

doi:10.48550/arXiv.2208.05800,Regressing Relative Fine-Grained Change for Sub-Groups in Unreliable Heterogeneous Data Through Deep Multi-Task Metric Learning,": Fine-Grained Change Detection and Regression Analysis are essential in many applications of Artificial Intelligence. In practice, this task is often challenging owing to the lack of reliable ground truth information and complexity arising from interactions between the many underlying factors affecting a system. Therefore, developing a framework which can represent the relatedness and reliability of multiple sources of information becomes critical. In this paper, we investigate how techniques in multi-task metric learning can be applied for the regression of fine-grained change in real data. The key idea is that if we incorporate the incremental change in a metric of interest between specific instances of an individual object as one of the tasks in a multi-task metric learning framework, then interpreting that dimension will allow the user to be alerted to fine-grained change invariant to what the overall metric is generalised to be. The techniques investigated are specifically tailored for handling heterogeneous data sources, i.e. the input data for each of the tasks might contain missing values, the scale and resolution of the values is not consistent across tasks and the data contains non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) instances. We present the results of our initial experimental implementations of this idea and discuss related research in this domain which may offer direction for further research.",ArXiv,2022,secondary,doi:10.48550/arXiv.2208.05800,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.48550/arXiv.2208.05800,

In the processing of simulated and experimental second harmonic signals, a series of standards, including the same correlation coefficient threshold and standard signal, are used to adaptively achieve noise reduction processing. After processing a simulated signal using PSO-VMD, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was improved by 4.03877 dB and the correlation coefficient (R2) between the gas concentration and the second harmonic maximum was improved from 0.97743 to 0.99782.

Accordingly, this cross-sectional study was performed to evaluate the echocardiography indices which are indicators of the cardiac alterations of the children with COVID19 infection. Methods: This study was performed as a cross-sectional study evaluating echocardiography indices in children infected with COVID19. Fifteen children, known cases of the COVID19, and 14 healthy children were enrolled. Evaluated parameters include left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF), left ventricle end-diastolic diameter (LVED), mitral valve Sa (MV Sa), Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), and laboratory parameters. Results: The participants' mean age and weight were 62.8 (±48.0) months and 19.95 (±15.67) kg, respectively. None of the laboratory and echocardiography parameters differed between males and females, between patients with and without positive past medical history, between the patients with and without respiratory tract symptoms, and between patients with and without GI tract symptoms (P.0.05). Patients had significantly higher TAPSE (p = 0.027), although MV Sa (p = 0.01) was significantly higher among healthy children. LV EF (p = 0.425) and LVED diameter (p = 0.603) were not different significantly. None of the patients had pericardial effusion, pleural effusion, and cardiac tamponade. Conclusion: The heart can be involved during the disease course in children, even at the level of echocardiography indices. This could contribute to a worse prognosis, higher morbidity, and mortality rate, especially in patients with overt myocardial involvement.

doi:10.1101/2022.08.09.503274,Comparison and benchmark of long-read based structural variant detection strategies,"Background Recent advances in long-read callers and assembly methods have greatly facilitated structural variants (SV) detection via read-based and assembly-based detection strategies. However, the lack of comparison studies, especially for SVs at complex genomic regions, complicates the selection of proper detection strategy for ever-increasing demand of SV analysis. Results In this study, we compared the two most widely-used strategies with six long-read datasets of HG002 genome and benchmarked them with well curated SVs at genomic regions of different complexity. First of all, our results suggest that SVs detected by assembly-based strategy are slightly affected by assemblers on HiFi datasets, especially for its breakpoint identity. Comparably, though read-based strategy is more versatile to different sequencing settings, aligners greatly affect SV breakpoints and type. Furthermore, our comparison reveals that 70% of the assembly-based calls are also detectable by read-based strategy and it even reaches 90% for SVs at high confident regions. While 60% of the assembly-based calls that are totally missed by read-based callers is largely due to the challenges of clustering ambiguous SV signature reads. Lastly, benchmarking with SVs at complex genomic regions, our results show that assembly-based approach outperforms read-based calling with at least 20X coverage, while read-based strategy could achieve 90% recall even with 5X coverage. Conclusions Taken together, with sufficient sequencing coverage, assembly-based strategy is able to detect SVs more consistently than read-based strategy under different settings. However, read-based strategy could detect SVs at complex regions with high sensitivity and specificity but low coverage, thereby suggesting its great potential in clinical application.",bioRxiv,2022,secondary,doi:10.1101/2022.08.09.503274,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2022.08.09.503274,
doi:10.1039/d3cs00417a,On-site airborne pathogen detection for infection risk mitigation,"Human-infecting pathogens that transmit through the air pose a significant threat to public health. As a prominent instance, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that caused the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the world in an unprecedented manner over the past few years. Despite the dissipating pandemic gloom, the lessons we have learned in dealing with pathogen-laden aerosols should be thoroughly reviewed because the airborne transmission risk may have been grossly underestimated. From a bioanalytical chemistry perspective, on-site airborne pathogen detection can be an effective non-pharmaceutic intervention (NPI) strategy, with on-site airborne pathogen detection and early-stage infection risk evaluation reducing the spread of disease and enabling life-saving decisions to be made. In light of this, we summarize the recent advances in highly efficient pathogen-laden aerosol sampling approaches, bioanalytical sensing technologies, and the prospects for airborne pathogen exposure measurement and evidence-based transmission interventions.

We present avidity sequencing, a sequencing chemistry that separately optimizes the processes of stepping along a DNA template and that of identifying each nucleotide within the template. Nucleotide identification uses multivalent nucleotide ligands on dye-labeled cores to form polymerase–polymer–nucleotide complexes bound to clonal copies of DNA targets. These polymer–nucleotide substrates, termed avidites, decrease the required concentration of reporting nucleotides from micromolar to nanomolar and yield negligible dissociation rates. Avidity sequencing achieves high accuracy, with 96.2% and 85.4% of base calls having an average of one error per 1,000 and 10,000 base pairs, respectively. We show that the average error rate of avidity sequencing remained stable following a long homopolymer.",Nature Biotechnology,2022,secondary,doi:10.1101/2022.11.03.514117,37231263,10791576,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2022.11.03.514117,

In adults, ischemic stroke is attributed to several risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, atherosclerosis, and diabetes. Alternatively, pediatric ischemic stroke is associated with a broad spectrum of etiologies including prematurity, congenital heart disease, arteriopathies like moyamoya, chronic inflammatory disease, sickle cell, hypercoagulability, and malignancy. In rare cases, AIS has been associated with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), a Kawasaki-like inflammatory disease affecting patients younger than 21 years of age. This recently recognized and rare condition has been linked to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and presentations can vary widely in terms of severity and systemic involvement. While the exact reason behind this association is unknown, there is a growing body of evidence in adult literature that links SARS-CoV-2 infection to hypercoagulability and immune-mediated thrombosis. In pediatric patients, this association is not very clear. We report a case of a 17-year-old, previously healthy male who presented with acute-onset expressive aphasia, right-sided hemiparesis, and facial droop after two weeks from experiencing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-like symptoms. A non-contrast head CT revealed an acute left M2 territory infarct while serum workup was consistent with MIS-C.

Despite decades of research, our understanding of Alzheimer's disease (AD) etiology remains incomplete. In recent years, appreciation has grown for potential roles for the microbiota in shaping neurological health.


OBJECTIVE
This study aimed to examine associations between the microbiota and AD in a human cross-sectional cohort.


METHODS
Forty-five AD patients and 54 matched controls were recruited in Vancouver, Canada. Fecal and oral samples underwent 16S microbiota sequencing. A wide array of demographic and clinical data were collected. Differences between participant groups were assessed, and associations between microbes and clinical variables were examined within the AD population.


RESULTS
The gut microbiota of AD patients displayed lower diversity relative to controls, although taxonomic differences were sparse. In contrast, the AD oral microbiota displayed higher diversity, with several taxonomic differences relative to controls, including a lower abundance of the families Streptococcaceae and Actinomycetaceae, and a higher abundance of Weeksellaceae, among others. The periodontitis-associated oral microbe Porphyromonas gingivalis was 5 times more prevalent among patients. No significant associations between gut or oral microbes and cognition were detected, but several correlations existed between microbes and mood disorders and BMI among patients, including a strong positive correlation between Alphaproteobacteria and depression score.


CONCLUSION
The gut microbiota of AD patients was not overtly different from controls, although it displayed lower diversity, an overall marker of microbiota health. The oral microbiota did display marked differences. Cognition was not associated with a microbial signature, but other relevant AD factors including mood and BMI did demonstrate an association.",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2022,secondary,doi:10.3233/jad-215520,35275538,,https://doi.org/doi:10.3233/jad-215520,

Objective Identify clinical, immunological, and histopathologic features of MIS-A to improve understanding of the pathophysiology and approach to treatment. Design Three cases of MIS-A following SARS-CoV-2 infection were clinically identified between October 2021 – March 2022 using the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention diagnostic criteria. Clinical, laboratory, imaging, and tissue data were assessed. Findings All three patients developed acute onset cardiogenic shock and demonstrated elevated inflammatory biomarkers at the time of hospital admission that resolved over time. One case co-occurred with new onset Type 1 diabetes and sepsis. Retrospective analysis of myocardial tissue from one case identified SARS-CoV-2 RNA. All three patients fully recovered with standard of care interventions plus immunomodulatory therapy that included intravenous immunoglobulin, corticosteroids, and in two cases, anakinra. Conclusion MIS-A is a severe post-acute sequela of COVID-19 characterized by systemic elevation of inflammatory biomarkers. In this series of three cases, we find that although clinical courses and co-existent diseases vary, even severe presentations have potential for full recovery with prompt recognition and treatment. In addition to cardiogenic shock, glucose intolerance, unmasking of autoimmune disease, and sepsis can be features of MIS-A, and SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis can lead to a similar clinical syndrome.",Frontiers in Medicine,2023,secondary,doi:10.3389/fmed.2023.1187420,37484839,10357379,https://doi.org/doi:10.3389/fmed.2023.1187420,

In this longitudinal multi-institutional study, we used multi-omics to identify novel time- and treatment-related immunopathological signatures in children with COVID-19 (n=105) and MIS-C (n=76). pCOVID-19 was characterized by enhanced type I IFN responses, and MIS-C by type II IFN- and NF-{kappa}B dependent responses, matrisome activation, and increased levels of Spike protein. Reduced levels of IL-33 in pCOVID-19, and of CCL22 in MIS-C suggested suppression of Th2 responses. Expansion of TRBV11-2 T-cell clonotypes in MIS-C was associated with inflammation and signatures of T-cell activation, and was reversed by glucocorticoids.

Recent advances in control of nanoscale structure have opened the door for development of a wide range of chemosensors for environmental monitoring. The soaring rate of environmental pollution through human activities and its negative impact on the ecosystem demands an urgent interest in developing rapid and efficient techniques that can easily be deployed for in-field assessment and environmental monitoring purposes. Organophosphate pesticides (OPPs) play a significant role for agricultural use; however, they also present environmental threats to human health due to their chemical toxicity. Plasmonic sensors are thus vital analytical detection tools that have been explored for many environmental applications and OPP detection due to their excellent properties such as high sensitivity, selectivity, and rapid recognition capability. Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) have also significantly been recognized as a highly efficient, low-cost, and sensitive synthetic sensing technique that has been adopted for environmental monitoring of a wide array of environmental contaminants, specifically for very small molecule detection. In this review, the general concept of MIPs and their synthesis, a summary of OPPs and environmental pollution, plasmonic sensing with MIPs, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) MIP sensors, and nanomaterial-based sensors for environmental monitoring applications and OPP detection have been elucidated according to the recent literature.

The stochastic process was dominant in the urban transit system microbiota assemblage. The urban transit system microbe’s ability in discriminating between cities was quantified using transfer learning based on random forest (RF) methods. Certain urban transit system microbes were strongly affected by city characteristics. ABSTRACT Microbiota residing on the urban transit systems (UTSs) can be shared by travelers and have niche-specific assemblage. However, it remains unclear how the assemblages are influenced by city characteristics, rendering city-specific and microbial-aware urban planning challenging. Here, we analyzed 3,359 UTS microbial samples collected from 16 cities around the world. We found the stochastic process dominated in all UTS microbiota assemblages, with the explanation rate (R2) of the neutral community model (NCM) higher than 0.7. Moreover, city characteristics predominantly drove such assemblage, largely responsible for the variation in the stochasticity ratio (50.1%). Furthermore, by utilizing an artificial intelligence model, we quantified the ability of UTS microbes in discriminating between cities and found that the ability was also strongly affected by city characteristics, especially climate and continent. From these, we found that although the NCM R2 of the New York City UTS microbiota was 0.831, the accuracy of the microbial-based city characteristic classifier was higher than 0.9. This is the first study to demonstrate the effects of city characteristics on the UTS microbiota assemblage, paving the way for city-specific and microbial-aware applications.

Yet, previous US studies utilized patient populations of limited size and geographic scope, leaving a knowledge gap regarding the national trend. Employing a large sample size will increase the generalizability of the results and allow for more detailed analyses. Methods: The observational study using the 2016–2020 National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample examined changes in the Kawasaki disease hospitalization rate in pediatric patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sensitivity analyses examined hospitalizations between October and December each year, as the code for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children was implemented in October 2020. Results: In total, 24,505 hospitalizations with Kawasaki disease diagnoses were examined. Hospitalization rates were 65.1 and 53.8 per 1,000,000 pediatric population during the prepandemic and pandemic periods, respectively. Sensitivity analyses showed an overall decrease of 36.1%, with larger decreases for patients 1–4 years old (49.6%), males (40.0%), Asians or Pacific Islanders (57.9%) and patients in the South (47.5%), compared with their counterparts. Associations of the pandemic period with longer lengths of stay and higher daily costs were detected (adjusted mean ratio 1.11; P < 0.01 for length of stay, and adjusted mean ratio 1.33, P < 0.01 for costs). Conclusions: A decrease in the incidence of Kawasaki disease during the COVID-19 pandemic was observed nationwide in the United States.

Recently, advances in sensor technology have promoted the ambitious requirement to build intelligent systems that can be controlled by external stimuli along with independent operation, adaptivity, and low energy expenditure. Among various sensing techniques, field-effect transistors (FETs) with channels made of two-dimensional (2D) materials attract increasing attention for advantages such as label-free detection, fast response, easy operation, and capability of integration. With atomic thickness, 2D materials restrict the carrier flow within the material surface and expose it directly to the external environment, leading to efficient signal acquisition and conversion.

MSI detection using tumour tissue is often limited by the availability of specimens. Next generation sequencing (NGS)-based MSI detection in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is challenged by a much lower signal-to-noise ratio. We developed a highly accurate cfDNA MSI detection method called bMSI-CAST (blood MSI Caller Adjusted with Sequence duplicaTes), with improvement on three features including a set of locus selection principles ensuring loci with high robustness and compatibility across sequencing platforms, an MSI-specific duplicate removal strategy, and a calling algorithm that dynamically matches baselines with a broad range of duplication levels. Analytical validation via MSI-high (MSI-H) cell gDNA showed an LOD of 0.15%.

Wastewater surveillance (WWS), i.e., monitoring COVID-19 infections in communities through detecting viruses in wastewater, was applied to track the emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants globally. However, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding of the use and effectiveness of WWS for new SARS-CoV-2 variants. Here we systematically reviewed published articles reporting monitoring of different SARS-CoV-2 variants in wastewater by following the PRISMA guidelines and provided the current state of the art of this study area. A total of 80 WWS studies were found that reported different monitoring variants of SARS-CoV-2 until November 2022. Most of these studies (66 out of the total 80, 82.5%) were conducted in Europe and North America, i.e., resource-rich countries. There was a high variation in WWS sampling strategy around the world, with composite sampling (50/66 total studies, 76%) as the primary method in resource-rich countries. In contrast, grab sampling was more common (8/14 total studies, 57%) in resource-limited countries. Among detection methods, the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based sequencing method and quantitative RT-PCR method were commonly used for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 variants in wastewater. Among different variants, the B1.1.7 (Alpha) variant that appeared earlier in the pandemic was the most reported (48/80 total studies), followed by B.1.617.2 (Delta), B.1.351 (Beta), P.1 (Gamma), and others in wastewater. All variants reported in WWS studies followed the same pattern as the clinical reporting within the same timeline, demonstrating that WWS tracked all variants in a timely way when the variants emerged. Thus, wastewater monitoring may be utilized to identify the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 and follow the development and transmission of existing and emerging variants. Routine wastewater monitoring is a powerful infectious disease surveillance tool when implemented globally.",Water,2023,secondary,doi:10.3390/w15061018,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/w15061018,

Consequently, biosensing methods that target viral proteases have contributed to the study of virus-related diseases. This work presents a ratiometric electrochemical sensor that enables highly sensitive detection of viral proteases through the integration of target proteolysis-activated in vitro transcription and the DNA-functionalized electrochemical interface. In particular, each viral protease-mediated proteolysis triggers the transcription of multiple RNA outputs, leading to amplified ratiometric signals on the electrochemical interface. Using the NS3/4A protease of the hepatitis C virus as a model, this method achieves robust and specific NS3/4A protease sensing with sub-femtomolar sensitivity. The feasibility of this sensor was demonstrated by monitoring NS3/4A protease activities in virus-infected cell samples with varying viral loads and post-infection times. This study provides a new approach to analyzing viral proteases and holds the potential for developing direct-acting antivirals and novel therapies for viral infections.",Analytical chemistry,2023,secondary,doi:10.1021/acs.analchem.3c01720,37410966,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1021/acs.analchem.3c01720,

We detected and quantified enteric pathogen-associated gene targets in aerosol samples near open wastewater canals (OWCs) or impacted (receiving sewage or wastewater) surface waters and control sites in La Paz, Bolivia; Kanpur, India; and Atlanta, USA, via multiplex reverse-transcription qPCR (37 targets) and ddPCR (13 targets). We detected a wide range of enteric targets, some not previously reported in extramural urban aerosols, with more frequent detections of all enteric targets at higher densities in La Paz and Kanpur near OWCs. We report density estimates ranging up to 4.7 × 102 gc per mair3 across all targets including heat-stable enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, enteroinvasive E. coli/Shigella spp., Salmonella spp., norovirus, and Cryptosporidium spp. Estimated 25, 76, and 0% of samples containing positive pathogen detects were accompanied by culturable E. coli in La Paz, Kanpur, and Atlanta, respectively, suggesting potential for viability of enteric microbes at the point of sampling.

Some modified oligonucleotide analogs, such as antisense oligonucleotides, have been developed and used as innovative therapeutic agents in some areas of medicine. Many ways to build DNA nanomaterials with predefined shape and function characteristics have been designed. Thus, molecules of potent antitumor drugs, including doxorubicin, therapeutic oligonucleotides, and complex nanoparticles, have been loaded into or conjugated with DNA-based nanomaterials. It was found that DNA-based nanomaterials can increase the efficiency of drug uptake by cells. In this review, we would like to draw attention to some DNA-based nanomaterials, such as tetrahedrons, origami, DNA nanotubes, and aptamers, that have been used as carriers, drugs or target molecules for anticancer drug delivery. Abstract DNA nanotechnology has significantly advanced and might be used in biomedical applications, drug delivery, and cancer treatment during the past few decades. DNA nanomaterials are widely used in biomedical research involving biosensing, bioimaging, and drug delivery since they are remarkably addressable and biocompatible. Gradually, modified nucleic acids have begun to be employed to construct multifunctional DNA nanostructures with a variety of architectural designs. Aptamers are single-stranded nucleic acids (both DNAs and RNAs) capable of self-pairing to acquire secondary structure and of specifically binding with the target. Diagnosis and tumor therapy are prospective fields in which aptamers can be applied. Many DNA nanomaterials with three-dimensional structures have been studied as drug delivery systems for different anticancer medications or gene therapy agents. Different chemical alterations can be employed to construct a wide range of modified DNA nanostructures. Chemically altered DNA-based nanomaterials are useful for drug delivery because of their improved stability and inclusion of functional groups. In this work, the most common oligonucleotide nanomaterials were reviewed as modern drug delivery systems in tumor cells.",Cancers,2023,secondary,doi:10.3390/cancers15072151,37046816,10093432,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/cancers15072151,

The assembled QD conjugates are then used as optically addressable probes, relying on Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) interactions as a transduction mechanism to detect the activity of MMP-14 in solution phase. The QDs were first coated with dithiolane poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) bearing a carboxyl group that allows coupling via amide bond formation with different dye-labeled peptides. The analytical capability of the conjugates is enabled by correlating changes in the FRET efficiency with the conjugate valence and/or QD-to-dye separation distance, triggered and modulated by enzymatic proteolysis of surface-tethered peptides. The FRET probe exhibits great sensitivity to enzyme digestion with sub-nanomolar limit of detection. We further analyze the proteolysis data within the framework of the Michaelis-Menten model, which considers the fact that surface-attached peptides have a slower diffusion coefficient than free peptides. This results in reduced collision frequency and lower catalytic efficiency, kcat/KM. Our results suggest that our conjugate design is promising, effective, and potentially useful for in vivo analysis.",Analytical chemistry,2023,secondary,doi:10.1021/acs.analchem.2c03400,36705737,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1021/acs.analchem.2c03400,

A Literature Review","The epidemic curve of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is silently rising again. Worldwide, the dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern (VOC) is Omicron, and its virological characteristics, such as transmissibility, pathogenicity, and resistance to both vaccine- and infection-induced immunity as well as antiviral drugs, are an urgent public health concern. The Omicron variant has five major sub-lineages; as of February 2022, the BA.2 lineage has been detected in several European and Asian countries, becoming the predominant variant and the real antagonist of the ongoing surge. Hence, although global attention is currently focused on dramatic, historically significant events and the multi-country monkeypox outbreak, this new epidemic is unlikely to fade away in silence. Many aspects of this lineage are still unclear and controversial, but its apparent replication advantage and higher transmissibility, as well as its ability to escape neutralizing antibodies induced by vaccination and previous infection, are rising global concerns.

Methods This is a cross-sectional retrospective study consisting of pediatric patients diagnosed with MIS-C who were treated with anakinra. Results Among the 378 patients diagnosed with MIS-C, 82 patients (21.6%) who were treated with anakinra were included in the study. The median age of patients was 115 (6-214) months. The median duration of hospitalization was 15 (6-42) days. Sixty patients (73.1%) were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit. Patients were treated with a median dose of 2.7 mg/kg/day anakinra concomitant with IVIG and steroids. Intravenous anakinra was applied to 12 patients while 70 patients received it subcutaneously. Twenty-eight patients required high dose (4–10 mg/kg/day) anakinra. The median day of anakinra initiation was 2 (1-14) days and the median duration of anakinra use was 7 (1-41) days. No injection site reactions were observed while elevated transaminase levels were detected in 13 patients. Seventy-three patients (89.1%) were discharged without any sequela or morbidity. Seven patients (1.8%) died. Abnormal echocardiographic findings continued in two patients (2.4%) (coronary artery dilatation in one, low ejection fraction in one) at discharge and became normal on the 2nd month.

Considering the unequal quantity of endogenous spikes and lipid membranes on SARS-CoV-2, a dual-domain binding strategy, with two aptamers targeting different spike domains, was applied to balance the spike-envelope stoichiometric ratio. By balancing the stoichiometric with DNA computation and promoting microscale mass transfer of the herringbone chip, the developed strategy enabled high sensitivity detection of pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 with a limit of detection as low as 37 active virions/μL while distinguishing it from inactive counterparts, other nontarget viruses, and free spike protein. Moreover, the captured viral particles can be released through DNase I treatment with up to 90% efficiency, which is fully compatible with virus culture and sequencing.

Surveillance of variants is typically performed by whole genome sequencing (WGS), which can be financially prohibitive and requires specialized equipment and bioinformatic expertise. Genotyping approaches are rapid methods for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 variants but require continuous adaptation. Fragment analysis may represent an approach for improved SARS-CoV-2 variant detection. Methods A multiplex fragment analysis approach (CoVarScan) was validated using PCR targeting variants by size and fluorescent color. Eight SARS-CoV-2 mutational hot spots in variants of concern (VOCs) were targeted. Three primer pairs (recurrently deleted region [RDR] 1, RDR2, and RDR3–4) flank RDRs in the S-gene. Three allele-specific primers target recurrent spike receptor binding domain mutants. Lastly, 2 primer pairs target recurrent deletions or insertions in ORF1A and ORF8. Fragments were resolved and analyzed by capillary electrophoresis (ABI 3730XL), and mutational signatures were compared to WGS results. Results We validated CoVarScan using 3544 clinical respiratory specimens. The assay exhibited 96% sensitivity and 99% specificity compared to WGS. The limit of detection for the core targets (RDR1, RDR2, and ORF1A) was 5 copies/reaction. Variants were identified in 95% of samples with cycle threshold (CT) <30 and 75% of samples with a CT 34 to 35. Assay design was frozen April 2021, but all subsequent VOCs have been detected including Delta (n = 2820), Mu, (n = 6), Lambda (n = 6), and Omicron (n = 309). Genotyping results are available in as little as 4 h.

The current article summarizes updates on multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) research and focuses on strategies to diagnose and manage these patients in the emergency department.


RECENT FINDINGS
MIS-C is an inflammatory syndrome that occurs approximately 4-5 weeks after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. It is associated with symptoms such as fever, shock, abdominal pain, rash, and conjunctivitis along with laboratory abnormalities such as elevated inflammatory markers, coagulation factors, and cytokines. Patients fall into the following three subcategories: first, classic or incomplete Kawasaki; second, cardiogenic or distributive shock; or third, an inflammatory response that does not initially meet criteria of the other subcategories. Immediate treatment largely focuses on supportive care through fluid resuscitation and pressor support; however, inpatient management may also include intravenous immunoglobulin, steroids, anticoagulation and at times anti-inflammatory biologics.


SUMMARY
Overall fatality rate remains low and short-term research has demonstrated self-limited sequelae. Pediatricians should focus on the timely diagnosis and identification of this inflammatory disease via clinical findings and laboratory evidence to best treat these patients.",Current opinion in pediatrics,2021,secondary,doi:10.1097/MOP.0000000000001020,33928912,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1097/MOP.0000000000001020,

Usually, imaging modes were classified into ""always-on"" mode and ""activatable"" mode. Conventional ""always-on"" acoustic-based probes often have difficulty distinguishing lesion regions of interest from surrounding healthy tissues due to poor target-to-background signal ratios. As compared, activatable probes have attracted attention with improved sensitivity, which can boost or amplify imaging signals only in response to specific biomolecular recognition or interactions. The tumor microenvironment (TME) exhibits abnormal physiological conditions that can be used to identify tumor sections from normal tissues. Various types of organic dyes and biomaterials can react with TME, leading to obvious changes in their optical properties. The TME also affects the self-assembly or aggregation state of nanoparticles, which can be used to design activatable imaging probes. Moreover, acoustic-based imaging probes and therapeutic agents can be coencapsulated into one nanocarrier to develop nanotheranostic probes, achieving tumor imaging and cooperative therapy. Satisfactorily, ultrasound waves not only accelerate the release of encapsulated therapeutic agents but also activate therapeutic agents to exert or enhance their therapeutic performance. Meanwhile, various photoacoustic probes can convert photon energy into heat under irradiation, achieving photoacoustic imaging and cooperative photothermal therapy. In this review, we focus on the recently developed TME-triggered ultrasound and photoacoustic theranostic probes for precise tumor imaging and targeted tumor therapy.",ACS sensors,2022,secondary,doi:10.1021/acssensors.2c02129,36455009,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1021/acssensors.2c02129,

Due to its high infectivity, it is crucial to track SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks early to prevent the spread of infection. Wastewater monitoring appears to be a powerful and effective tool for managing epidemiological situations. Due to emerging mutations of SARS-CoV-2, there is a need to monitor mutations in order to control the pandemic. Since the sequencing of randomly chosen individuals is time-consuming and expensive, sequencing of wastewater plays an important role in revealing the dynamics of infection in a population. The sampling method used is a crucial factor and significantly impacts the results. Wastewater can be collected as a grab sample or as a 24 h composite sample. Another essential factor is the sample volume, as is the method of transport used. This review discusses different pretreatment procedures and RNA extraction, which may be performed using various methods, such as column-based extraction, TRIzol, or magnetic extraction. Each of the methods has its advantages and disadvantages, which are described accordingly. RT-qPCR is a procedure that confirms the presence of SARS-CoV-2 genes before sequencing.

Machine Learning Prediction in Genomic Sequences of Prokaryotic Viruses from Metagenomic Datasets. 2021. 79 pages. Ph.D. Thesis. Bioinformatics Graduate Program, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo. Environmental viruses are extremely diverse and abundant in the biosphere. Several studies have shown prokaryotic viruses (or simply phages) as major players in determining biogeochemical cycles in oceans as well as driving microbial diversification. Besides this ecological role, phages may also be used for clinical purposes since they can kill bacterial cells and terminate infections. A crucial step in this process is the isolation of new phages, which can target a specific bacterial pathogen. Thus, researchers employ screening techniques to find and isolate pathogen-specific phages from environmental samples, which are a rich source of new phages. However, this task remains mostly exploratory and laborious if the researcher has no detailed information about the sample and its potential viral diversity. Having this problem in mind, we propose the development of a bioinformatic workflow to identify genomic sequences belonging to phages in environmental datasets, as well as for host prediction of the identified phages based on their genomic sequences. To achieve this goal, we implemented a random forest classifier and created the tool named MARVEL (Metagenomic Analyses and Retrieval of Viral Elements), which is able to efficiently predict phage genomic sequences in bins generated from whole community metagenomic short reads. We also developed a toolkit, name vHULK (Viral Host Unveiling Kit), which can predict phage’s host given only their genome as input. vHULK presents higher accuracy than available tools and it can predict both host species and genus in a multiclass prediction setting. Data generated by the application of both tools in public and private composting metagenomic datasets is used for recovery, annotation, and characterization of phage diversity in composting environments. Both tools are publicly available through a GitHub repository: https://github.com/LaboratorioBioinformatica/.",,2022,secondary,doi:10.11606/t.95.2022.tde-17022022-091454,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.11606/t.95.2022.tde-17022022-091454,

Over a dozen potently neutralizing NTD-directed antibodies have been studied structurally, and all target a single antigenic supersite in NTD (site 1). Here we report the 3.7 Å resolution cryo-EM structure of a potent NTD-directed neutralizing antibody 5-7, which recognizes a site distinct from other potently neutralizing antibodies, inserting a binding loop into an exposed hydrophobic pocket between the two sheets of the NTD β-sandwich. Interestingly, this pocket has been previously identified as the binding site for hydrophobic molecules including heme metabolites, but we observe their presence to not substantially impede 5-7 recognition.

SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus, and what constitutes immunological responses in different human body sites in infected individuals is yet to be presented. We set to determine the various immune cell fractions in gargle solution, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, nasopharyngeal, and urine samples post-SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans. Materials and methods: We downloaded proteomics data from (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ ) with the following identifiers: PXD019423, n=3 (gargle solution), PXD018970, n=15 (urine), PXD022085, n=5 (Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid), PXD022889, n=18 (nasopharyngeal). MaxQuant was used for the peptide spectral matching using humans, and SARS-CoV-2 was downloaded from the UniProt database (Access date 9th January 2022). The protein count matrix was extracted from the proteins group file and used as an input for the cibersort for the immune cells fraction determination. Results: The body of individuals infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus is characterized by different fractions of immune cells in Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), nasopharyngeal, urine, and gargle solution. BALF has more abundant memory B cells, CD8, activated mast cells, and resting macrophages than urine, nasopharyngeal, and gargle solution. Our analysis also demonstrates that each body site comprises different immune cell fractions post-SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans. Conclusion: Different body sites are characterized by different immune cells fractions in SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. The findings in this study can inform public health policies and health professionals on treatment strategies and drive SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis procedures.",,2022,secondary,doi:10.1101/2022.01.21.22269631,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2022.01.21.22269631,

doi:10.1101/2022.08.07.499047,Multiple pathways for SARS-CoV-2 resistance to nirmatrelvir,"Nirmatrelvir, an oral antiviral targeting the 3CL protease of SARS-CoV-2, has been demonstrated to be clinically useful in reducing hospitalization or death due to COVID-191,2. However, as SARS-CoV-2 has evolved to become resistant to other therapeutic modalities3–9, there is a concern that the same could occur for nirmatrelvir. Here, we have examined this possibility by in vitro passaging of SARS-CoV-2 in increasing concentrations of nirmatrelvir using two independent approaches, including one on a large scale in 480 wells. Indeed, highly resistant viruses emerged from both, and their sequences revealed a multitude of 3CL protease mutations. In the experiment done at a larger scale with many replicates, 53 independent viral lineages were selected with mutations observed at 23 different residues of the enzyme. Yet, several common mutational pathways to nirmatrelvir resistance were preferred, with a majority of the viruses descending from T21I, P252L, or T304I as precursor mutations. Construction and analysis of 13 recombinant SARS-CoV-2 clones, each containing a unique mutation or a combination of mutations showed that the above precursor mutations only mediated low-level resistance, whereas greater resistance required accumulation of additional mutations. E166V mutation conferred the strongest resistance (~100-fold), but this mutation resulted in a loss of viral replicative fitness that was restored by compensatory changes such as L50F and T21I. Structural explanations are discussed for some of the mutations that are proximal to the drug-binding site, as well as cross-resistance or lack thereof to ensitrelvir, another clinically important 3CL protease inhibitor. Our findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 resistance to nirmatrelvir does readily arise via multiple pathways in vitro, and the specific mutations observed herein form a strong foundation from which to study the mechanism of resistance in detail and to inform the design of next generation protease inhibitors.",bioRxiv,2022,secondary,doi:10.1101/2022.08.07.499047,36032976,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2022.08.07.499047,

 Ten emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants—B.1.1.298, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, P.2, B.1.429, B.1.525, B.1.526-1, B.1.526-2, B.1.1.318—and seven corresponding single amino acid mutations in the receptor-binding domain were examined using SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. The results indicate that the current SARS-CoV-2 variants do not increase infectivity among humans. The K417N/T, N501Y, or E484K-carrying variants exhibited increased abilities to infect to mouse ACE2-overexpressing cells. The activities of Furin, TMPRSS2, and cathepsin L were increased against most of the variants. RBD amino acid mutations comprising K417T/N, L452R, Y453F, S477N, E484K, and N501Y caused significant immune escape from 11 of 13 monoclonal antibodies. However, the resistance to neutralization by convalescent serum or vaccines was mainly caused by the E484K mutation, while the neutralization of E484K-carrying variants was decreased by 1.1–6.2-fold. The convalescent serum from B.1.1.7- and B.1.351-infected patients neutralized the variants themselves better than other SARS-CoV-2 variants.",,2021,secondary,doi:10.21203/RS.3.RS-492659/V1,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.21203/RS.3.RS-492659/V1,

Very few studies have investigated the impact of acute SARS-CoV-2 within the nasopharynx, the site of initial infection and viral replication. In this study we profiled changes in the nasal microbial communities as well as in host transcriptional profile during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection using 16S amplicon sequencing and RNA sequencing. These analyses were coupled to viral genome sequencing. Our microbiome analysis revealed that the nasal microbiome of COVID patients was unique and was marked by an expansion of bacterial pathogens. Some of these microbes (i.e. Acinetobacter) were shared with COVID negative health care providers from the same medical center but absent in COVID negative outpatients seeking care at the same institutions suggesting acquisition of nosocomial respiratory pathogens. Specifically, we report a distinct increase in the prevalence and abundance of the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa in COVID patients that correlated with viral RNA load. These data suggest that the inflammatory environment caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection and potentially exposure to the hospital environment leads to an expansion of bacterial pathogens in the nasal cavity that could contribute to increased incidence of secondary bacterial infections. Additionally, we observed a robust host transcriptional response in the nasal epithelia of COVID patients, indicative of an antiviral innate immune repones and neuronal damage. Finally, analysis of viral genomes did not reveal an association between viral loads and viral sequences.",bioRxiv,2021,secondary,doi:10.1101/2021.05.20.445008,34031657,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2021.05.20.445008,

Multiple Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) is a delayed and severe complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection that strikes previously healthy children. As MIS-C combines clinical features of Kawasaki disease and Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS), we aimed to compare the immunological profile of pediatric patients with these different conditions. We analyzed blood cytokine expression, and the T cell repertoire and phenotype in 36 MIS-C cases, which were compared to 16 KD, 58 TSS, and 42 COVID-19 cases. We observed an increase of serum inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-10, IL-18, TNF-α, IFNγ, CD25s, MCP1, IL-1RA) in MIS-C, TSS and KD, contrasting with low expression of HLA-DR in monocytes. We detected a specific expansion of activated T cells expressing the Vβ21.3 T cell receptor β chain variable region in both CD4 and CD8 subsets in 75% of MIS-C patients and not in any patient with TSS, KD, or acute COVID-19; this correlated with the cytokine storm detected. The T cell repertoire returned to baseline within weeks after MIS-C resolution. Vβ21.3+ T cells from MIS-C patients expressed high levels of HLA-DR, CD38 and CX3CR1 but had weak responses to SARS-CoV-2 peptides in vitro. Consistently, the T cell expansion was not associated with specific classical HLA alleles. Thus, our data suggested that MIS-C is characterized by a polyclonal Vβ21.3 T cell expansion not directed against SARS-CoV-2 antigenic peptides, which is not seen in KD, TSS and acute COVID-19.",Science Immunology,2021,secondary,doi:10.1126/sciimmunol.abh1516,34035116,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1126/sciimmunol.abh1516,

Here, we assessed a cohort of 74 CID patients treated as monotherapy with chronic immunosuppressive drugs for functional antibody responses in serum against historical and variant SARS-CoV-2 viruses after immunization with Pfizer mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine. Longitudinal analysis showed the greatest reductions in neutralizing antibodies and Fc effector function capacity in individuals treated with TNF-alpha inhibitors, and this pattern appeared worse against the B.1.617.2 Delta virus. Within five months of vaccination, serum neutralizing titers of the majority of CID patients fell below the presumed threshold correlate for antibody-mediated protection. Thus, further vaccine boosting or administration of long-acting prophylaxis (e.g., monoclonal antibodies) likely will be required to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in this susceptible population.",,2021,secondary,doi:10.1101/2021.09.28.21264250,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2021.09.28.21264250,

Inhibitors of the RBD-ACE2 interaction are therefore promising drug candidates in treating COVID-19. Here, we report a covalent bonding aptamer that can block the RBD-ACE2 interaction and neutralize SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection by forming covalent bonds on RBD, resulting in more than 25-fold enhancement of pseudovirus neutralization efficacy over the original binding aptamer. The chemically modified aptamer is equipped with sulfur(VI) fluoride exchange (SuFEx) modifications and covalently targets important RBD residues within the RBD-ACE2 binding interface, including Y453 and R408.

Leveraging Dianox’s extensive aptamer database, we introduce a novel computational approach, AptaBERT, built upon the BERT architecture. This method utilizes self-supervised pre-training on vast amounts of data, followed by supervised fine-tuning to enhance the prediction of aptamer interactions with proteins and small molecules. AptaBERT is fine-tuned for binary classification tasks, distinguishing between positive and negative interactions with proteins and small molecules.

This level of control is equally important for the development of artificial active materials. In this study, we successfully controlled the distribution of small molecules in the system at nonequilibrium states by actively transporting them, even against the apparent concentration gradient, with high selectivity. As a demonstration, in the aqueous solution of acid orange (AO7) and TMC10COOH, we found that AO7 molecules can coassemble with transient anhydride (TMC10CO)2O to form larger assemblies in the presence of chemical fuel 1-ethyl-3-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC). This led to a decrease in local free AO7 concentration and caused AO7 molecules from other locations in the solution to move toward the assemblies. Consequently, AO7 accumulates at the location where EDC was injected. By continuously injecting EDC, we could maintain a stable high value of the apparent AO7 concentration at the injection point. We also observed that this process which operated at nonequilibrium states exhibited high selectivity.",Journal of the American Chemical Society,2024,secondary,doi:10.1021/jacs.3c12228,38273768,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1021/jacs.3c12228,

Immunoglobulin E (IgE) is an immunoglobulin that mediates allergic sensitization to various allergens and is related to various allergic diseases. However, few studies have analyzed specific IgE on allergy biomarkers after KD is diagnosed. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the pattern of specific IgE levels against food and inhalant allergens. Methods: This retrospective study was conducted in Taiwan to identify patients admitted with KD. A subset of 453 admitted KD children younger than or equal to five years of age with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was followed up at our clinic with available specific IgE data. Results: The most common allergens were Dermatophagoides farina or pteronyssinus, house-dust, and cockroach mix. Positive specific IgE for Dermatophagoides farina or pteronyssinus was less common in children diagnosed with KD who were two years old or younger (p = 0.028). KD patients with higher basophils before IVIG (p = 0.010 and 0.018 for two different mites) and higher C-reactive protein (CRP, p = 0.030 and 0.028) after IVIG were at higher risk of mite sensitization. Integrated mite sensitization demonstrated higher basophils before IVIG, age at KD diagnosis, and the male sex to be clinically meaningful after logistic regression models. Conclusions: This study is the first to suggest that specific IgE in KD patients may be correlated with age at KD diagnosis, as well as basophils.

In Chile, the prevalence of this disease in children is around 15% and has a high impact in the health system. Studies suggest that asthma is caused by multiple factors, including host genetics, antibiotic use, and the development of the airway microbiota. Here, we used 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing to characterize the nasal and oral mucosae of 63 asthmatic and 89 healthy children (152 samples) from Santiago, Chile. We found that the nasal mucosa was dominated by a high abundance of Moraxella, Dolosigranulum, Haemophilus, Corynebacterium, Streptococcus, and Staphylococcus. In turn, the oral mucosa was characterized by a high abundance of Streptococcus, Haemophilus, Gemella, Veillonella, Neisseria, and Porphyromonas. Our results showed significantly (P < 0.001) lower alpha diversity and an over-abundance of Streptococcus (P < 0.01) in nasal samples from asthmatics compared to samples from healthy subjects. Community structure, as revealed by co-occurrence networks, showed different microbial interactions in asthmatic and healthy subjects, particularly in the nasal microbiota. The networks revealed keystone genera in each body site, including Prevotella, Leptotrichia, and Porphyromonas in the nasal microbiota, and Streptococcus, Granulicatella, and Veillonella in the oral microbiota. We also detected 51 functional pathways differentially abundant on the nasal mucosa of asthmatic subjects, although only 13 pathways were overrepresented in the asthmatic subjects (P < 0.05). We did not find any significant differences in microbial taxonomic (composition and structure) and functional diversity between the oral mucosa of asthmatic and healthy subjects.

Here, we show that bubbles can eject abundant bacteria to the air, form stable biofilms over the air-water interface, and provide opportunities for cell-cell contact that facilitates horizontal gene transfer at and over the air-liquid interface. The extracellular matrix (ECM) on bacteria can increase bubble attachment on biofilms, increase bubble lifetime, and, thus, produce abundant small droplets.

In this paper, a squaraine derivative was synthesized as probe molecules, and the sensing characteristics of VX in a colorimetric solution system containing tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TABF) were studied with UV−Vis spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), and mass spectrometry. The results showed that the binding of the thiol moiety of VX to the quaternary ring of the squaraine probe changed the molecular conjugation system, and that the rapid colorimetric detection of micro-trace VX was achieved based on color change before and after interaction with squaraine, enabling the detection limit of VX to be as low as 0.4 μg/mL. Moreover, the colorimetry method also possessed satisfactory sensitivity and could detect VX from other organophosphorus pesticides (e.g., parathion and dichlorvos), phosphorus-containing reagents (e.g., diethyl chlorophosphate and dimethyl methylphosphonate), a benzene series (e.g., toluene), and acid and base agents (e.g., acetic acid and triethylamine, respectively), which demonstrated that squaraine-based colorimetry could provide fast, on-site measurement results for VX detection. The strategy of this research could be extended as a common approach for the detection of other organophosphorus nerve agents or organophosphorus pesticides.",Chemosensors,2023,secondary,doi:10.3390/chemosensors11020137,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/chemosensors11020137,

Two predominant subclades within the B.1.526 lineage have been identified, one containing the E484K mutation in the receptor-binding domain (1,2), which attenuates in vitro neutralization by multiple SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and is present in variants of concern (VOCs) first identified in South Africa (B.1.351) (4) and Brazil (P.1).* The NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) analyzed laboratory and epidemiologic data to characterize cases of B.1.526 infection, including illness severity, transmission to close contacts, rates of possible reinfection, and laboratory-diagnosed breakthrough infections among vaccinated persons. Preliminary data suggest that the B.1.526 variant does not lead to more severe disease and is not associated with increased risk for infection after vaccination (breakthrough infection) or reinfection. Because relatively few specimens were sequenced over the study period, the statistical power might have been insufficient to detect modest differences in rates of uncommon outcomes such as breakthrough infection or reinfection.

In this issue, Nguyen and colleagues pioneered an in situ investigation on the impact of protist predations on the soil microbial community and its antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). They found that bacterivorous protists consistently increased the abundance of ARGs, such as tetracycline resistant genes. Indeed, antibiotic production is a common strategy for bacteria to evade protist predation. The rise of ARGs can be explained by the balance between antibiotic producers and resisters shaped by predatory selection. This work suggests that ARG enrichment due to biotic interactions may be less worrisome than previously thought. Unless, these ARGs are carried by or disseminated among pathogens. Therefore, it is essential to monitor the occurrence, dissemination and pathogenic hosts of ARGs, enhancing our capacity to combat antibiotic resistance.",The ISME Journal,2024,secondary,doi:10.1093/ismejo/wrad007,,10811726,https://doi.org/doi:10.1093/ismejo/wrad007,
doi:10.1128/msystems.00961-22,Inferring microbial co-occurrence networks from amplicon data: a systematic evaluation,"ABSTRACT Microbes commonly organize into communities consisting of hundreds of species involved in complex interactions with each other. 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) amplicon profiling provides snapshots that reveal the phylogenies and abundance profiles of these microbial communities. These snapshots, when collected from multiple samples, can reveal the co-occurrence of microbes, providing a glimpse into the network of associations in these communities. However, the inference of networks from 16S data involves numerous steps, each requiring specific tools and parameter choices. Moreover, the extent to which these steps affect the final network is still unclear. In this study, we perform a meticulous analysis of each step of a pipeline that can convert 16S sequencing data into a network of microbial associations. Through this process, we map how different choices of algorithms and parameters affect the co-occurrence network and identify the steps that contribute substantially to the variance. We further determine the tools and parameters that generate robust co-occurrence networks and develop consensus network algorithms based on benchmarks with mock and synthetic data sets. The Microbial Co-occurrence Network Explorer, or MiCoNE (available at https://github.com/segrelab/MiCoNE) follows these default tools and parameters and can help explore the outcome of these combinations of choices on the inferred networks. We envisage that this pipeline could be used for integrating multiple data sets and generating comparative analyses and consensus networks that can guide our understanding of microbial community assembly in different biomes. IMPORTANCE Mapping the interrelationships between different species in a microbial community is important for understanding and controlling their structure and function. The surge in the high-throughput sequencing of microbial communities has led to the creation of thousands of data sets containing information about microbial abundances. These abundances can be transformed into co-occurrence networks, providing a glimpse into the associations within microbiomes. However, processing these data sets to obtain co-occurrence information relies on several complex steps, each of which involves numerous choices of tools and corresponding parameters. These multiple options pose questions about the robustness and uniqueness of the inferred networks. In this study, we address this workflow and provide a systematic analysis of how these choices of tools affect the final network and guidelines on appropriate tool selection for a particular data set. We also develop a consensus network algorithm that helps generate more robust co-occurrence networks based on benchmark synthetic data sets.

doi:10.1128/mbio.01468-23,Comparison of metagenomic and targeted methods for sequencing human pathogenic viruses from wastewater,"ABSTRACT Wastewater-based epidemiology is a powerful tool for monitoring the emergence and spread of viral pathogens at the population scale. Typical polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods of quantitative and genomic monitoring of viruses in wastewater provide high sensitivity and specificity. However, these methods are limited to the surveillance of target viruses in a single assay and require prior knowledge of the target genome(s). Metagenomic sequencing methods may represent a target-agnostic approach to viral wastewater monitoring, allowing for the detection of a broad range of target viruses, including potentially novel and emerging pathogens. In this study, targeted and untargeted metagenomic sequencing methods were compared with tiled-PCR sequencing for the detection and genotyping of viral pathogens in wastewater samples. Deep shotgun metagenomic sequencing was unable to generate sufficient genome coverage of human pathogenic viruses for robust genomic epidemiology, with samples dominated by bacteria. Hybrid-capture enrichment of shotgun libraries for respiratory viruses led to significant increases in genome coverage for a range of targets. Tiled-PCR sequencing led to further improvements in genome coverage compared to hybrid capture for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, enterovirus D68, norovirus GII, and human adenovirus F41 in wastewater samples. In conclusion, untargeted shotgun sequencing was unsuitable for genomic monitoring of the low virus concentrations in wastewater samples analyzed in this study. Hybrid-capture enrichment represented a viable method for simultaneous genomic epidemiology of a range of viral pathogens, while tiled-PCR sequencing provided the optimal genome coverage for individual viruses with the minimum sequencing depth. IMPORTANCE Most public health initiatives that monitor viruses in wastewater have utilized quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and whole genome PCR sequencing, mirroring techniques used for viral epidemiology in individuals. These techniques require prior knowledge of the target viral genome and are limited to monitoring individual or small groups of viruses. Metagenomic sequencing may offer an alternative strategy for monitoring a broad spectrum of viruses in wastewater, including novel and emerging pathogens. In this study, while amplicon sequencing gave high viral genome coverage, untargeted shotgun sequencing of total nucleic acid samples was unable to detect human pathogenic viruses with enough sensitivity for use in genomic epidemiology. Enrichment of shotgun libraries for respiratory viruses using hybrid-capture technology provided genotypic information on a range of viruses simultaneously, indicating strong potential for wastewater surveillance. This type of targeted metagenomics could be used for monitoring diverse targets, such as pathogens or antimicrobial resistance genes, in environmental samples.

Unfortunately, direct estimation of this effectiveness is difficult in practice, elevating the value of mathematical modeling that can predict it from first principles. Here, we introduce testing effectiveness (TE), defined as the fraction by which transmission is reduced via testing and post-diagnosis isolation at the population scale, and develop a mathematical model that estimates it from the interactions of tests, within-host pathogen dynamics, and arbitrarily complex testing behaviors. While our model generalizes across pathogens, we demonstrate its flexibility through an analysis of three respiratory pathogens, influenza A, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and both pre-vaccine and post-vaccine era SARS-CoV-2, quantifying TE across post-exposure, post-symptom, and routine testing scenarios. We show that TE varies considerably by strategy and pathogen, with optimal testing depending on the number of tests available and when they are used.

doi:10.1128/AEM.01448-21,RNA Viromics of Southern California Wastewater and Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Single-Nucleotide Variants,"Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) can detect pathogens across sewersheds, which represents the collective waste of human populations. As there is a wide diversity of RNA viruses in wastewater, monitoring the presence of these viruses is useful for public health, industry, and ecological studies. ABSTRACT Municipal wastewater provides an integrated sample of a diversity of human-associated microbes across a sewershed, including viruses. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is a promising strategy to detect pathogens and may serve as an early warning system for disease outbreaks. Notably, WBE has garnered substantial interest during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic to track disease burden through analyses of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA. Throughout the COVID-19 outbreak, tracking SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater has been an important tool for understanding the spread of the virus. Unlike traditional sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from clinical samples, which adds testing burden to the health care system, in this study, metatranscriptomics was used to sequence virus directly from wastewater. Here, we present a study in which we explored RNA viral diversity through sequencing 94 wastewater influent samples across seven wastewater treatment plants (WTPs), collected from August 2020 to January 2021, representing approximately 16 million people in Southern California. Enriched viral libraries identified a wide diversity of RNA viruses that differed between WTPs and over time, with detected viruses including coronaviruses, influenza A, and noroviruses. Furthermore, single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) of SARS-CoV-2 were identified in wastewater, and we measured proportions of overall virus and SNVs across several months. We detected several SNVs that are markers for clinically important SARS-CoV-2 variants along with SNVs of unknown function, prevalence, or epidemiological consequence. Our study shows the potential of WBE to detect viruses in wastewater and to track the diversity and spread of viral variants in urban and suburban locations, which may aid public health efforts to monitor disease outbreaks. IMPORTANCE Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) can detect pathogens across sewersheds, which represents the collective waste of human populations. As there is a wide diversity of RNA viruses in wastewater, monitoring the presence of these viruses is useful for public health, industry, and ecological studies. Specific to public health, WBE has proven valuable during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic to track the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) without adding burden to health care systems. In this study, we used metatranscriptomics and reverse transcription-droplet digital PCR (RT-ddPCR) to assay RNA viruses across Southern California wastewater from August 2020 to January 2021, representing approximately 16 million people from Los Angeles, Orange, and San Diego counties. We found that SARS-CoV-2 quantification in wastewater correlates well with county-wide COVID-19 case data, and that we can detect SARS-CoV-2 single-nucleotide variants through sequencing. Likewise, wastewater treatment plants (WTPs) harbored different viromes, and we detected other human pathogens, such as noroviruses and adenoviruses, furthering our understanding of wastewater viral ecology.",Applied and Environmental Microbiology,2021,secondary,doi:10.1128/AEM.01448-21,34550753,8579973,https://doi.org/doi:10.1128/AEM.01448-21,

However, due to its negative impact on human health, in particular reproductive functions and fetal development, the content of DBP must be controlled in food and the environment. The present study aims to develop a sensitive, fast and simple fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA) using monoclonal antibodies derived against DBP (MAb-DBP) for its detection in open waters. New conjugates of DBP with various fluorescein derivatives were obtained and characterized: 5-aminomethylfluorescein (AMF) and dichlorotriazinylaminofluorescein (DTAF). The advantages of using the DBP-AMF conjugate in the FPIA method are shown, the kinetics of binding of this chemical with antibodies are studied, the analysis is optimized, and the concentration of monoclonal antibodies is selected for sensitivity analysis—16 nM. The calibration dependence of the fluorescence polarization signal for the detection of DBP was obtained. The observed IC50 (DBP concentration at which a 50% decrease in the fluorescence polarization signal occurs, 40 ng/mL) and the limit of detection (LOD, 7.5 ng/mL) values were improved by a factor of 45 over the previously described FPIA using polyclonal antibodies. This technique was tested by the recovery method, and the high percentage of DBP discovery in water ranged from 85 to 110%. Using the developed method, real water samples from Lake Onega were tested, and a good correlation was shown between the results of the determination of DBP by the FPIA method and GC-MS. Thus, the FPIA method developed in this work can be used to determine DBP in open-water reservoirs.",Biosensors,2023,secondary,doi:10.3390/bios13121005,38131765,10741632,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/bios13121005,

Recent findings Pediatric patients with SARS-CoV-2 generally have mild illness; however, intensive care is required in about 20–30% of hospitalized children with COVID-19 and an even higher proportion in those with MIS-C. Increased rates of thrombosis have been observed in adults hospitalized with COVID-19, and clinical trials have attempted to optimize thromboprophylaxis. There is significant variability in the estimated incidence of thrombosis in pediatric patients (0–27%) because of variation in patient populations and study design. Multiple studies demonstrate an increased rate of thrombosis compared with baseline in hospitalized pediatric patients. Few studies have evaluated risk factors for thrombosis, but critical illness, older age, and other known thrombosis risk factors appear to increase the risk. Thromboprophylaxis strategies are inconsistent, with little evidence of efficacy but few reports of major bleeding. Summary Critically ill children with SARS-CoV-2-related illnesses are at increased risk of thrombosis. Thromboprophylaxis should be considered in select patients with COVID-19 or MIS-C, though the optimal strategy is not yet known. More data is required to guide practice to prevent thrombosis in this population.",Current Opinion in Pediatrics,2022,secondary,doi:10.1097/MOP.0000000000001130,35634699,9197313,https://doi.org/doi:10.1097/MOP.0000000000001130,
doi:10.1101/2023.03.07.23286904,The impact of signal variability on epidemic growth rate estimation from wastewater surveillance data,"Background: Testing samples of waste water for markers of infectious disease became a widespread method of surveillance during the COVID-19 pandemic. While these data generally correlate well with other indicators of national prevalence, samples that cover localised regions tend to be highly variable over short time scales. Methods: We introduce a procedure for estimating the real-time growth rate of pathogen prevalence using time series data from wastewater sampling. The number of copies of a target gene found in a sample is modelled as time-dependent random variable whose distribution is estimated using maximum likelihood. The output depends on a hyperparameter that controls the sensitivity to variability in the underlying data. We apply this procedure to data reporting the number of copies of the N1 gene of SARS-CoV-2 collected at water treatment works across Scotland between February 2021 and February 2023. Results: The real-time growth rate of the SARS-CoV-2 prevalence is estimated at 121 wastewater sampling sites covering a diverse range of locations and population sizes. We find that the sensitivity of the fitting procedure to natural variability determines its reliability in detecting the early stages of an epidemic wave. Applying the procedure to hospital admissions data, we find that changes in the growth rate are detected an average of 2 days earlier in wastewater than in hospital admissions data. Conclusion: We provide a robust method to generate reliable estimates of epidemic growth from highly variable data. Applying this method to samples collected at wastewater treatment works provides highly responsive situational awareness to inform public health.",,2023,secondary,doi:10.1101/2023.03.07.23286904,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2023.03.07.23286904,
doi:10.1093/femsmc/xtad006,Comprehensive mutation profiling from wastewater in southern Germany extends evidence of circulating SARS-CoV-2 diversity beyond mutations characteristic for Omicron,"Abstract Tracking SARS-CoV-2 variants in wastewater is primarily performed by detecting characteristic mutations of the variants. Unlike the Delta variant, the emergence of the Omicron variant and its sublineages as variants of concern has posed a challenge in using characteristic mutations for wastewater surveillance. In this study, we monitored the temporal and spatial variation of SARS-CoV-2 variants by including all the detected mutations and compared whether limiting the analyses to characteristic mutations for variants like Omicron impact the outcomes. We collected 24-hour composite samples from 15 wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) in Hesse and sequenced 164 wastewater samples with a targeted sequencing approach from September 2021 to March 2022. Our results show that comparing the number of all the mutations against the number of the characteristic mutations reveals a different outcome. A different temporal variation was observed for the ORF1a and S gene. As Omicron became dominant, we observed an increase in the overall number of mutations. Based on the characteristic mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 variants, a decreasing trend for the number of ORF1a and S gene mutations was noticed, though the number of known characteristic mutations in both genes is higher in Omicron than Delta.",FEMS Microbes,2023,secondary,doi:10.1093/femsmc/xtad006,37333432,10117852,https://doi.org/doi:10.1093/femsmc/xtad006,

Aptamer-based detection assays like ELONA are promising since they are inexpensive and sensitive. Aptamers have advantages over antibodies in wide modification, small size, in vitro selection, and stability under stringent conditions, which aid in scalable and reliable detection. In this work, we used aptamers against SARS-CoV-2 RBD S protein to design a simple and sensitive ELONA detection tool. Screening CoV2-RBD-1C and CoV2-RBD-4C aptamers and optimizing assay conditions led to the development of a direct ELONA that can detect SARS-CoV-2 RBD S glycoprotein in buffer solution and 0.1 % human nasal fluid with a detection limit of 2.16 ng/mL and 1.02 ng/mL, respectively. We detected inactivated Alpha, Wuhan, and Delta variants of SARS-CoV-2 with the detection limit of 3.73, 5.72, and 6.02 TCID50/mL, respectively. Using the two aptamers as capture and reporter elements, we designed a more sensitive sandwich assay to identify the three SARS-CoV-2 variants employed in this research. As predicted, a lower detection limit was obtained. Sandwich assay LOD was 2.31 TCID50/mL for Alpha, 1.15 TCID50/mL for Wuhan, and 2.96 TCID50/mL for Delta. The sensitivity of sandwich ELONA was validated using Alpha and Wuhan variants spiked in 0.1% human nasal fluid sample condition and were detected in 1.41 and 1.79 TCID50/mL LOD, respectively.

Kawasaki disease is a vasculitis that presents with fever and affects medium-sized arteries throughout the body. Although the etiology and pathophysiology of Kawasaki disease remain unknown, the emergence of the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) in 2020 is of significant interest due to its similarity in symptoms of Kawasaki disease and its association with SARS-CoV-2. Research on the pathophysiology of MIS-C is still ongoing and is expected to contribute to the explanation of the symptoms of Kawasaki disease in the future. The diagnosis and definition, clinical features, and treatment methods of Kawasaki disease and MIS-C, which may have such an important relationship, will be summarized.

Public health sectors implemented several control strategies, such as social distancing, hygienic measures, and the development of anti-viral drugs and vaccines. However, the situation is still critical due to several challenges facing the global control strategy. SARS-CoV-2 has undergone several mutations that will drive viral evolution, which might impact the virus’s transmissibility and pathogenicity and the immune escape and development of resistance to therapeutics. Moreover, although the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have approved several vaccines, however, some vaccines, especially vector-based vaccines, have rarely induced severe fatal side effects. These side effects led to widespread doubts about the safety of the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) vaccines, which in turn dragged a certain proportion of the public from getting vaccinated. This review highlights some of the ongoing challenges in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic, including side effects of the developed vaccines, potential mechanisms for the development of thrombocytopenia, and the clinical impacts of the emerged SARS-CoV-2 variants on the pathogenesis of the virus and vaccine efficacy. Additionally, we discuss the comorbidity and the potential role of gastrointestinal microbiota in controlling SARS-CoV-2.

However, it needs to be rigorously assessed for clinical utility. The present study is the first to evaluate the clinical characteristics of the host DNA-removed mNGS technology for detecting SARS-CoV-2, revealing host local immune signaling and assisting genomic epidemiology. Methods 46 swab specimens collected from COVID-19 patients were assayed by two approved commercial RT-qPCR kits and mNGS. The evolutionary tree of SARS-CoV-2 was plotted using FigTree directly from one sample. The workflow of removing the host and retaining the host was compared to investigate the influence of host DNA removal on the performances of mNGS. Functional enrichment analysis of DEGs and xCell score were used to explore the characteristics of host local immune signaling. Results The detection rate of mNGS achieved 92.9% (26/28) for 28 samples with a Ct value ≤ 35 and 81.1% (30/37) for all 46 samples. The genome coverage of SARS-CoV-2 could reach up to 98.9% when the Ct value is about 20 in swab samples. Removing the host could enhance the sensitivity of mNGS for detecting SARS-CoV-2 from the swab sample but does not affect the species abundance of microbes RNA. Improving the sequencing depth did not show a positive effect on improving the detection sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2. Cell type enrichment scores found multiple immune cell types were differentially expressed between patients with high and low viral load.

In a larger cohort from June 2020 to December 2020, we sought to determine whether our initial point estimate was stable as the pandemic continued and to understand radiographic and laboratory data that may clarify mechanisms of pediatric AIS in the setting of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We surveyed international sites with pediatric stroke expertise to determine numbers of hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients <18 years, numbers of incident AIS cases among children (29 days to <18 years), frequency of SARS-CoV-2 testing for children with AIS, and numbers of childhood AIS cases positive for SARS-CoV-2 June 1 to December 31, 2020. Two stroke neurologists with 1 neuroradiologist determined whether SARS-CoV-2 was the main stroke risk factor, contributory, or incidental. Results: Sixty-one centers from 21 countries provided AIS data. Forty-eight centers (78.7%) provided SARS-CoV-2 hospitalization data. SARS-CoV-2 testing was performed in 335/373 acute AIS cases (89.8%) compared with 99/166 (59.6%) in March to May 2020, P<0.0001.

Widespread use of at-home rapid COVID-19 antigen tests has been proposed as an important public health intervention to interrupt chains of transmission. Antigen tests may be preferred over PCR because they provide on-demand results for relatively low cost and can identify people when they are most likely to be infectious, particularly when used daily. Yet the extent to which a frequent antigen testing intervention will result in a positive public health impact for COVID-19 will depend on high acceptability and high adherence to such regimens. Methods. We conducted a mixed-methods study assessing acceptability of and adherence to a daily at-home mobile-app connected rapid antigen testing regimen among employees of a US-based media company. Acceptability was assessed across seven domains of the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability. Results. Among 31 study participants, acceptability of the daily testing intervention was generally high, with participants reporting high perceived effectiveness, intervention coherence, and self-efficacy; positive affective attitude; acceptable degree of burden and opportunity cost; and assessing the intervention as ethical. 71% reported a preference to test daily using an at-home antigen test than weekly employment-based PCR. Mean adherence to the 21-day testing regimen was 88% with 43% of participants achieving 100% adherence, 48% testing at least every other day, and 10% testing less than every other day. Conclusions. Despite overall high acceptability and adherence, we identified three implementation challenges that must be addressed for frequent serial testing for COVID-19 to be implemented at scale and have a positive public health impact. First, users need guidance on how and when to adapt testing frequencies to different epidemiological conditions. Second, users and institutions need guidelines for how to safely store and share test results. Third, implementation of serial testing strategies must prioritize health equity and protect those most vulnerable to COVID-19.",PLoS ONE,2022,secondary,doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0267766,35939422,9359568,https://doi.org/doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0267766,

Recent findings Several viral infections are potential triggers of reactive and autoimmune diseases by inducing type II and type IV hypersensitivity reactions. Recent evidence demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection is not an exception, triggering the production of tissue-specific autoantibodies during the acute phase of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and leading to autoimmune diseases development as long-term complication. The significant immune dysregulation with cytokine storm and organ damage observed in patients with severe to critical COVID-19 is considered the main mechanism explaining the high levels of autoantibodies, which are also implicated in disease severity and the need for an intensive care assessment. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is an immune-mediated disease where the recent viral infection leads to systemic inflammation, as already observed in other reactive and autoimmune diseases. Summary Autoimmunity may be a complication of SAR-CoV-2 infection.

Hundreds of different assays exist today to take advantage of Illumina short-read sequencers, the predominant short-read sequencing technology available today. Although other short read sequencing technologies exist, the ubiquity of Illumina sequencers in sequencing core facilities, and the high capital costs of these technologies have limited their adoption. Among a new generation of sequencing technologies, Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) holds a unique position because the ONT MinION, an error-prone long-read sequencer, is associated with little to no capital cost. Here we show that we can make short-read Illumina libraries compatible with the ONT MinION by using the R2C2 method to circularize and amplify the short library molecules. This results in longer DNA molecules containing tandem repeats of the original short library molecules. This longer DNA is ideally suited for the ONT MinION, and after sequencing, the tandem repeats in the resulting raw reads can be converted into high-accuracy consensus reads with similar error rates to that of the Illumina MiSeq. We highlight this capability by producing and benchmarking RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, as well as regular and target-enriched Tn5 libraries.

Currently, isolating for fixed time is adapted in most countries. However, given the variability in viral dynamics between patients, some patients may no longer be infectious by the end of isolation (thus they are redundantly isolated), whereas others may still be infectious. Utilizing viral test results to determine ending isolation would minimize both the risk of ending isolation of infectious patients and the burden due to redundant isolation of noninfectious patients. In our previous study, we proposed a computational framework using SARS-CoV-2 viral dynamics models to compute the risk and the burden of different isolation guidelines with PCR tests. In this study, we extend the computational framework to design isolation guidelines for COVID-19 patients utilizing rapid antigen tests. Time interval of tests and number of consecutive negative tests to minimize the risk and the burden of isolation were explored. Furthermore, the approach was extended for asymptomatic cases. We found the guideline should be designed considering various factors: the infectiousness threshold values, the detection limit of antigen tests, symptom presence, and an acceptable level of releasing infectious patients. Especially, when detection limit is higher than the infectiousness threshold values, more consecutive negative results are needed to ascertain loss of infectiousness. To control the risk of releasing of infectious individuals under certain levels, rapid antigen tests should be designed to have lower detection limits than infectiousness threshold values to minimize the length of prolonged isolation, and the length of prolonged isolation increases when the detection limit is higher than the infectiousness threshold values, even though the guidelines are optimized for given conditions.",medRxiv,2022,secondary,doi:10.1101/2022.01.24.22269769,35118478,8811911,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2022.01.24.22269769,

Metagenomic approaches provide unbiased descriptions of taxonomy and antimicrobial resistance genes in many environments, but for surface water, culture independent data is insufficient to describe critically important resistance. To address this challenge and expand resistome reporting capacity of antimicrobial resistance in surface waters, we apply metagenomic and quasimetagenomic (enriched microbiome) data to examine and contrast water from two sites, a creek near a hospital, and a reservoir used for recreation and municipal water. Approximately 30% of the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System’s critically important resistance gene targets were identified in enriched data contrasted to only 1% in culture independent data. Four different analytical approaches consistently reported substantially more antimicrobial resistance genes in quasimetagenomic data compared to culture independent data across most classes of antimicrobial resistance. Statistically significant differential fold changes (p<0.05) of resistance determinants were used to infer microbiological differences in the waters. Important pathogens associated with critical antimicrobial resistance were described for each water source. While the single time-point for only two sites represents a small pilot project, the successful reporting of critically important resistance determinants is proof of concept that the quasimetagenomic approach is robust and can be expanded to multiple sites and timepoints for national and global monitoring and surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in surface waters.",bioRxiv,2022,secondary,doi:10.1101/2022.04.22.489054,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2022.04.22.489054,
doi:10.3390/biology12091223,Exploring the Immune Response against RSV and SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Children,"Simple Summary Respiratory viral infections are among the most common diseases that affect children. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common pathogen causing lower tract infections in children and is responsible for a significant number of hospital admissions, whereas, in adults, its clinical importance is less significant. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, rarely causes severe disease in children. In this review, we discuss the differences in susceptibility between these two viruses in children with a focus on the immune response. A better understanding of the immune responses induced by SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, as well as their unique roles in viral evasion, is essential for the development of vaccines and new drugs. Abstract Viral respiratory tract infections are a significant public health concern, particularly in children. RSV is a prominent cause of lower respiratory tract infections among infants, whereas SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global pandemic with lower overall severity in children than in adults. In this review, we aimed to compare the innate and adaptive immune responses induced by RSV and SARS-CoV-2 to better understand differences in the pathogenesis of infection. Some studies have demonstrated that children present a more robust immune response against SARS-CoV-2 than adults; however, this response is dissimilar to that of RSV. Each virus has a distinctive mechanism to escape the immune response. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these differences is crucial for developing effective treatments and improving the management of pediatric respiratory infections.",Biology,2023,secondary,doi:10.3390/biology12091223,37759622,10525162,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/biology12091223,

Measuring cellular tensions to elucidate mechanotransduction pathways typically involves high-resolution but low throughput imaging of surfaces and arduous experimental preparation of materials. We present here Rupture and Deliver DNA-duplex based molecular tension sensors-RAD-TGTs. RAD-TGTs consist of immobilized DNA duplexes conjugated to a ligand and indicator (fluorophore, barcode etc) which rupture in a force-dependent manner when cells are bound. Readout of rupture is performed in cells of interest using high throughput methods such as flow cytometry and leveraging covalent DNA-protein linking HUH-tags simplifies the preparation of the tension sensor to allow use of “off-the-shelf” oligos. We demonstrate that rupture and delivery is decreased by inhibitors of cytoskeletal dynamics and knockout of mechanosensing proteins. We also show that rupture and delivery correlates with ligand affinity. Excitingly, we demonstrate that rupture and delivery of barcoded DNA-duplexes can be quantified using DNA sequencing, propelling cellular force measurements into the -omics era.",bioRxiv,2022,secondary,doi:10.1101/2022.11.08.515662,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2022.11.08.515662,

Methods Serum from 20 MIS-C children at admission, and 14 control children were analyzed. Antigen specific antibody isotypes and subclasses directed against various antigens of SARS-CoV-2 as well as against human common coronavirus (HCoVs) and commensal or pathogenic microorganisms were assessed by a bead-based multiplexed serological assay and by ELISA. The functionality of these antibodies was also assessed using a plaque reduction neutralization test, a RBD-specific avidity assay, a complement deposition assay and an antibody-dependent neutrophil phagocytosis (ADNP) assay. Results Children with MIS-C developed a stronger IgA antibody response in comparison to children with uncomplicated COVID-19, while IgG and IgM responses are largely similar in both groups. We found a typical class-switched antibody profile with high level of IgG and IgA titers and a measurable low IgM due to relatively recent SARS-CoV-2 infection (one month). SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies of MIS-C children had higher functional properties (higher neutralization activity, avidity and complement binding) as compared to children with uncomplicated COVID-19. There was no difference in the response to common endemic coronaviruses between both groups. However, MIS-C children had a moderate increase against mucosal commensal and pathogenic strains, reflecting a potential association between a disruption of the mucosal barrier with the disease. Conclusion Even if it is still unclear why some children develop a MIS-C, we show here that MIS-C children produce higher titers of IgA antibodies, and IgG antibodies with higher functionality, which could reflect the local gastro-intestinal mucosal inflammation potentially induced by a sustained SARS-CoV-2 gut infection leading to continuous release of SARS-CoV-2 antigens.",Frontiers in Immunology,2023,secondary,doi:10.3389/fimmu.2023.1107156,37006315,10050384,https://doi.org/doi:10.3389/fimmu.2023.1107156,

In this study, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was measured serially in 44 wastewater treatment plants of varying service capacities comprising approximately 67% of the population of Minnesota, from September 2020 through December 2022. We employed linear regression models to establish a predictive relationship between the weekly SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in wastewater and clinical case counts. Metrics were assessed under specified transformation and normalization methods which we confirmed by cross-validation averaged across the enrolled treatment plants. We report that the relationship between COVID-19 incidence and SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater may be treatment plant-specific. Toward establishing guidelines for pathogen surveillance, we further studied storage and time-to-analysis for RNA wastewater data and observed large effects of storage temperature, indicating that collection methods may have an important effect on the utility and validity of wastewater data for infectious disease monitoring.

However, this pathway results in reduced ability to neutralize S-protein Receptor Binding Domains (RBDs) from several Variants of Concern (VOC) and the rapid waning of memory B cell response requiring vaccine reformulation to cover dominant VOC S-proteins and multiple boosters. Here we show for the first time in mice and humans, that a bacterially derived, non-living, nanocell (EDV; EnGeneIC Dream Vector) packaged with plasmid expressed SARS-CoV-2 S-protein and α-galactosyl ceramide adjuvant (EDV-COVID-αGC), stimulates an alternate pathway due to dendritic cells (DC) displaying both S-polypeptides and αGC thereby recruiting and activating iNKT cells with release of IFNγ. This triggers DC activation/maturation, activation of follicular helper T cells (TFH), cognate help to B cells with secretion of a cytokine milieu promoting B cell maturation, somatic hypermutation in germinal centers to result in high affinity antibodies. Surrogate virus neutralization tests show 90-100% neutralization of ancestral and early VOC in mice and human trial volunteers. EDV-COVID-αGC as a third dose booster neutralized Omicron BA. 4/5. Serum and PBMC analyses reveal long lasting S-specific memory B and T cells.

In fact, in the infected host, SARS‐CoV‐2 consists in an ensemble of replicating and closely related viral variants so‐called quasispecies. Here we show that intrahost single nucleotide variants (iSNVs) represent a target for contact tracing analysis. Our data indicate that in the acute phase of infection, in highly likely transmission links, the number of viral particles transmitted from one host to another (bottleneck size) is large enough to propagate iSNVs among individuals. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, during SARS‐CoV‐2 outbreaks when the consensus sequences are identical, it is possible to reconstruct the transmission chains by genomic investigations of iSNVs.

Cases included SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals with extremely high viral loads early in their illness, individuals having low SARS-CoV-2 viral loads early in their infection, and individuals testing negative for SARS-CoV-2. We could identify widespread transcriptional host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection that were initially most strongly manifested in patients with extremely high initial viral loads, then attenuating within the patient over time as viral loads decreased. Genes correlated with SARS-CoV-2 viral load over time were similarly differentially expressed across independent datasets of SARS-CoV-2 infected lung and upper airway cells, from both in vitro systems and patient samples.

Additionally, national surveillance systems can derive substantial benefits from genomic data, as they offer profound insights into pathogen epidemiology and the emergence of antimicrobial-resistant strains. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a pressing global public health issue. While clinical laboratories have traditionally relied on culture-based antimicrobial susceptibility testing, the integration of genomic data into AMR analysis holds immense promise. Genomic-based AMR data can furnish swift, consistent, and highly accurate predictions of resistance phenotypes for specific strains or populations, all while contributing invaluable insights for surveillance. Moreover, genome sequencing assumes a pivotal role in the investigation of hospital outbreaks. It aids in the identification of infection sources, unveils genetic connections among isolates, and informs strategies for infection control. The One Health initiative, with its focus on the intricate interconnectedness of humans, animals, and the environment, seeks to develop comprehensive approaches for disease surveillance, control, and prevention.

Methods: A prospective cohort study was performed to analyze the laboratory parameters, antibody response, immune phenotypes and cytokine profiles of 51 children with different clinical presentations of COVID-19. Results: We found that the absolute lymphocyte counts gradually decreased with disease severity. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels in the acute phase and convalescence were not significantly different in patients with different disease severity. A decrease in CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was observed as disease severity increased. Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were activated in children with COVID-19, but no difference in the percentage of HLADR+-expressing cells was detected across the severity groups. In contrast, MIS-C patients exhibited augmented exhausted effector memory CD8+ T cells.

The clinical manifestations of severe COVID-19 include acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causal agent of COVID-19, spreads through contaminated droplets. SARS-CoV-2 particles have been detected in the saliva of COVID-19 patients, implying that the virus can infect and damage the oral cavity. The oral manifestations of COVID-19 include xerostomia and gustatory dysfunction. Numerous studies showed that the four structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are its potential pathogenic factors, especially the S protein, which binds to human ACE2 receptors facilitating the entry of the virus into the host cells. Usually, upon entry into the host cell, a pathogen triggers the host’s immune response. However, a mount of multi-omics and immunological analyses revealed that COVID-19 is caused by immune dysregulation.

The past year has been marked by the emergence of variants that have led to a succession of epidemic waves. It thus appears that monitoring the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater alone is insufficient, and it may be important in the future to also monitor the evolution of these variants. We used a real-time RT-PCR screening test for variants in the wastewater of our city to assess the effectiveness of direct SARS-CoV-2 sequencing from the same wastewater. We compared the genome sequencing results obtained over the large RS network and the smaller B7 network with the different distributions of the variants observed by RT-PCR screening. The prevalence of the “UK variant” in the RS and B7 networks was estimated to be 70% and 8% using RT-PCR screening compared to 95% and 64% using genome sequencing, respectively. The latter values were close to the epidemiology observed in patients of the corresponding area, which were 91% and 58%, respectively. Genome sequencing in sewage identified SARS-CoV-2 of lineage B.1.525 in B7 at 27% (37% in patients), whereas it was completely missed by RT-PCR. We thus determined that direct sequencing makes it possible to observe, in wastewater, a distribution of the variants comparable to that revealed by genomic monitoring in patients and that this method is more accurate than RT-PCR. It also shows that, rather than a single large sample, it would be preferable to analyse several targeted samples if we want to more appropriately assess the geographical distribution of the different variants. In conclusion, this work supports the wider surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 variants in wastewater by genome sequencing and targeting small areas on the condition of having a sequencing capacity and, when this is not the case, to developing more precise screening tests based on the multiplexed detection of the mutations of interest.",Pathogens,2021,secondary,doi:10.3390/pathogens10081042,34451505,8401729,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/pathogens10081042,

Examples of metadata can include a node’s source samples (called labels), genomic coordinates, expression levels, etc. An important property of these graphs is that the set of sequences spelled by graph walks is a superset of the set of input sequences. Thus, when aligning to graphs indexing samples derived from low-coverage sequencing sets, sequence information present in many target samples can compensate for missing information resulting from a lack of sequence coverage. Aligning a query against an entire sequence graph (as in traditional sequence-to-graph alignment) using state-of-the-art algorithms can be computationally intractable for graphs constructed from thousands of samples, potentially searching through many non-biological combinations of samples before converging on the best alignment. To address this problem, we propose a novel alignment strategy called multi-label alignment (MLA) and an algorithm implementing this strategy using annotated De Bruijn graphs within the MetaGraph framework, called MetaGraph-MLA. MLA extends current sequence alignment scoring models with additional label change operations for incorporating mixtures of samples into an alignment, penalizing mixtures that are dissimilar in their sequence content. To overcome disconnects in the graph that result from a lack of sequencing coverage, we further extend our graph index to utilize a variable-order De Bruijn graph and introduce node length change as an operation. In this model, traversal between nodes that share a suffix of length < k – 1 acts as a proxy for inserting nodes into the graph. MetaGraph-MLA constructs an MLA of a query by chaining single-label alignments using sparse dynamic programming. We evaluate MetaGraph-MLA on simulated data against state-of-the-art sequence-to-graph aligners. We demonstrate increases in alignment lengths for simulated viral Illumina-type (by 6.5%), PacBio CLR-type (by 6.2%), and PacBio CCS-type (by 6.7%) sequencing reads, respectively, and show that the graph walks incorporated into our MLAs originate predominantly from samples of the same strain as the reads’ ground-truth samples. We envision MetaGraph-MLA as a step towards establishing sequence graph tools for sequence search against a wide variety of target sequence types.",bioRxiv,2022,secondary,doi:10.1101/2022.11.04.514718,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2022.11.04.514718,

Some of these mutations have impacted the performance of nucleic acid amplification tests like PCR, which are commonly used as diagnostic tools to detect an infection. ABSTRACT In 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) enabled manufacturers to request emergency use authorization (EUA) to facilitate the rapid authorization of in vitro diagnostic (IVD) platforms for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Uncommon SARS-CoV-2 point mutations could cause nucleocapsid (N) gene target failure (NGTF) when using first-generation Xpert Xpress assays, so improvements were designed and implemented. In response to NGTF reports and with consideration of viral genomic information in public databases, the Xpress assays were redesigned to mitigate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 mutations on qualitative assay performance. The second-generation assays include a third gene target (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [RdRp]) and redundant oligonucleotide probes for the N2 target. First- and second-generation assay performances were evaluated using a challenge set of samples. A second-generation assay with updated oligonucleotide chemistry received FDA EUA in September 2021. A prototype assay with oligonucleotide chemistry similar to that of the second-generation assay with FDA EUA successfully detected all three gene targets (N2, envelope [E], and RdRp) in all challenge samples (100%; 50/50), including variants with N gene mutations (g.29197C>T or g.29200C>T), which caused NGTF in the first-generation assays. Investigation and reporting of IVD target failures, public sharing of viral genomic sequence data, and the FDA EUA pathway were essential components in facilitating a short cycle time from the identification of mutations that impact the performance of an IVD assay to the design and implementation of an improved IVD assay. IMPORTANCE The SARS-CoV-2 genome has mutated during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Some of these mutations have impacted the performance of nucleic acid amplification tests like PCR, which are commonly used as diagnostic tools to detect an infection. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) emergency use authorization (EUA) process enables the rapid reformulation and regulatory authorization of improved PCRs. In our experience, the identification of SARS-CoV-2 mutations that impact PCR performance, the subsequent development of improved PCR chemistry, and the use of the FDA EUA regulatory pathway led to improved diagnostic performance during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic that is able to keep pace with the rapidly evolving genome of SARS-CoV-2.",Microbiology Spectrum,2022,secondary,doi:10.1128/spectrum.01355-22,36255326,9769917,https://doi.org/doi:10.1128/spectrum.01355-22,

SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) is the main causative agent for this disease outbreak. The pandemic created a critical impact on the global economy. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019 was followed by a period of relative evolutionary stasis that lasted about 11 months. Since, late 2020, SARS-CoV-2 evolution has been characterized by the emergence of sets of mutations. This resulted so far, in over 2.7 million deaths and near about 122 million infection cases. Most mutations in the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genome are either deleterious and swiftly purged or relatively neutral. As far as the concern is the variants it impacts the virus characteristics, including antigenicity and transmissibility in response to the modification of the human immune profile. In recent days, COVID-19 affected cases are rapidly increasing and it became difficult to inhibit this virus as they are continuously mutated in the host cell forming various new strains like B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, P.2, B.1.1.529, etc. These monitoring, surveillance of variation, and sequencing efforts within the SARS-CoV-2 genome enabled the rapid identification of the first some of Variants of Concern (VOCs) in late 2020, where genome changes became the most observable impact on virus biology and disease transmission. In this review article, we tried to focus and spot the light on the genetic diversification of various strains, their nature, similarities and dissimilarities, mechanism of action, and the prophylactic interventions which could prevent this life-threatening disease in the long run. ",International Journal of Life Science and Pharma Research,2022,secondary,doi:10.22376/ijpbs/lpr.2022.12.5.l206-220,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.22376/ijpbs/lpr.2022.12.5.l206-220,

Objective: To describe off-label indications of IV anakinra, corresponding dosing and safety profiles, particularly during the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods: A retrospective, single-cohort study was conducted at an academic medical center to evaluate use of IV anakinra in hospitalized pediatric patients (age ≤21 years). Institutional Review Board review was considered exempt. The primary endpoint was the primary indication(s) for IV anakinra. The key secondary endpoints were dosing of IV anakinra, previous immunomodulatory therapies, and adverse events. Results: Of 14 pediatric patients, 8 (57.1%) received IV anakinra for treatment of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19, whereas 3 and 2 were treated for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and flares of systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SoJIA), respectively. The initial dosing regimen of IV anakinra for MIS-C associated with COVID-19 was a median dose of 2.25 mg/kg/dose with a median dosing interval of 12 hours for a median initial treatment duration of 3.5 days.

We evaluated the stability of monkeypox virus (MPXV) in different environments and specific body fluids and tested the effectiveness of decontamination methodologies. MPXV decayed faster at higher temperatures, and rates varied considerably depending on the medium in which virus was suspended, both in solution and on surfaces. More proteinaceous fluids supported greater persistence. Chlorination was an effective decontamination technique, but only at higher concentrations. Wastewater was more difficult to decontaminate than plain deionized water; testing for infectious MPXV could be a helpful addition to PCR-based wastewater surveillance when high levels of viral DNA are detected.

Variable outcomes of the infection and disease severity can be influenced by pre-existing risk factors. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the cause of AIDS, targets the gut mucosal immune system and impairs epithelial barriers and mucosal immunity. We sought to determine the impact and mechanisms of pre-existing HIV infection increasing mucosal vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease. We investigated changes in the expression of ACE2 and other SARS-CoV-2 receptors and related pathways in virally inflamed gut by using the SIV infected rhesus macaque model of HIV/AIDS. Immunohistochemical analysis showed sustained/enhanced ACE2 expression in the gut epithelium of SIV infected animals compared to uninfected controls. Gut mucosal transcriptomic analysis demonstrated enhanced expression of host factors that support SARS-CoV-2 entry, replication, and infection. Metabolomic analysis of gut luminal contents revealed the impact of SIV infection as demonstrated by impaired mitochondrial function and decreased immune response, which render the host more vulnerable to other pathogens. In summary, SIV infection resulted in sustained or increased ACE2 expression in an inflamed and immune-impaired gut mucosal microenvironment. Collectively, these mucosal changes increase the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease severity and result in ineffective viral clearance.

Although the first reports indicated that activity of the virus is centered in the lungs, it was soon acknowledged that SARS-CoV-2 causes a multisystem disease. Indeed, this new pathogen causes a variety of syndromes, including asymptomatic disease; mild disease; moderate disease; a severe form that requires hospitalization, intensive care, and mechanical ventilation; multisystem inflammatory disease; and a condition called long COVID or postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Some of these syndromes resemble previously described disorders, including those with no confirmed etiology, such as Kawasaki disease. After recognition of a distinct multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, followed by a similar syndrome in adults, various multisystem syndromes occurring during the pandemic associated or related to SARS-CoV-2 began to be identified. A typical pattern of cytokine and chemokine dysregulation occurs in these complex syndromes; however, the disorders have distinct immunological determinants that may help to differentiate them.

In this study, we explored the local and national landscape of the viral variants in the period immediately preceding the second wave to gain insight into the mechanism of emergence of the delta variant and thus improve our understanding of the causation of the second wave. We randomly selected 20 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples diagnosed in our lab between 3 February and 8 March 2021 and subjected them to whole genome sequencing. Nine of the 20 sequenced genomes were classified as kappa variant (B.1.617.1). The phylogenetic analysis of pan-India SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences also suggested the gradual replacement of the α variant with the kappa variant during this period. This relative consolidation of the kappa variant was significant, since it shared 3 of the 4 signature mutations (L452R, E484Q and P681R) observed in the spike protein of delta variant and thus was likely to be the precursor in its evolution. This study demonstrates the predominance of the kappa variant in the period immediately prior to the second wave and underscores its role as the “bridging variant” between the α and delta variants that drove the first and second waves of COVID-19 in India, respectively.",Genes,2021,secondary,doi:10.3390/genes12111803,34828410,8620562,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/genes12111803,

Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a rarely seen severe complication of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Although fever is one of the indispensable symptoms, other infections should be considered in the differential diagnosis during the pandemic.


Case report
An 8-year-old and a 16-year-old female patient were admitted with fever, vomiting, headache. Both had fulfilled the criteria and were diagnosed with MIS-C. However, they both had remarkable persistent costovertebral angle tenderness, which was unexpected in MIS-C. In Case-1, urine analysis showed microscopic hematuria without pyuria, and urine culture showed no bacterial growth. Case-2 had microscopic hematuria and pyuria with Escherichia coli growth in urine culture. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed wedge-shaped hypodense multiple lesions in bilateral kidneys for Case-1, in the right kidney for Case-2. They diagnosed acute focal bacterial nephritis (AFBN).


Conclusions
The diagnostic criteria of MIS-C can overlap with the symptoms of other severe septic infections such as AFBN, which is a rare urinary tract infection, diagnosed by imaging of localized renal inflammatory mass-like or wedge-shaped lesion. A detailed anamnesis and careful physical examination may help differential diagnosis.",Germs,2021,secondary,doi:10.18683/germs.2021.1299,35096681,,https://doi.org/doi:10.18683/germs.2021.1299,

We characterized seven anti-SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) antibodies for binding activity, pairing capability, and neutralization activity to SARS-CoV-2 and three variant RBDs via lateral flow immunoassays. The results allowed us to group these antibodies into three distinct epitope bins.

The antibody escaped by the SA and BR P.1 RBDs retained binding activity to SA and BR P.1 RBDs but was unable to induce neutralization. We demonstrated that lateral flow immunoassay could be a rapid and effective tool for antibody characterization, including epitope classification and antibody neutralization kinetics.

The symptom (fever and fever) resolution time, inflammatory factors (C-reactive protein, CRP; procalcitonin, PCT; interleukin-6, IL-6), immune indicators (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T lymphocytes CD3+, CD4+, and CD4+/CD8+), and incidence of adverse reactions were compared between the groups. The results identified shorter fever and rash resolution time in Obs compared with Con. The posttreatment CRP, PCT, IL-6, and CD8+ and the incidence of adverse events reduced notably in Obs and were lower than Con, while CD3+, CD4+, and CD4+/CD8+ elevated statistically and were higher than that of Con. Our results indicate that GC plus IVIG can significantly promote symptom resolution, alleviate inflammatory response, and improve immune function in children with Ig-insensitivity KD, with favorable safety and clinical promotion value.",Journal of Healthcare Engineering,2022,secondary,doi:10.1155/2022/9011259,35463656,9020913,https://doi.org/doi:10.1155/2022/9011259,

However, artificial light‐driven intelligent micromachines with a low actuation threshold, rapid responsiveness, and designable and precise 3D transformation capability remain unachievable to date. Here, a single‐material and one‐step 4D printing strategy are proposed to enable the nanomanufacturing of agile and low‐threshold light‐driven 3D micromachines with programmable shape‐morphing characteristics. The as‐developed carbon nanotube‐doped composite hydrogel simultaneously enhanced the light absorption, thermal conductivity, and mechanical modulus of the crosslinked network, thus significantly increasing the light sensitivity and response speed of micromachines. Moreover, the structural design and assembly of asymmetric microscale mechanical metamaterial unit cells enable the highly efficient additive nanomanufacturing of 3D shape‐morphable micromachines with large dynamic modulation and spatiotemporal controllability. Using this strategy, the world's smallest artificial beating heart with programmable light‐stimulus responsiveness for the cardiac cycle is successfully printed.

doi:10.1039/d2lc00021k,Microfluidic point-of-care device for detection of early strains and B.1.1.7 variant of SARS-CoV-2 virus.,"Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, several mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 virus have emerged. Current gold standard detection methods for detecting the virus and its variants are based on PCR-based diagnostics using complex laboratory protocols and time-consuming steps, such as RNA isolation and purification, and thermal cycling. These steps limit the translation of technology to the point-of-care and limit accessibility to under-resourced regions. While PCR-based assays currently offer the possibility of multiplexed gene detection, and commercial products of single gene PCR and isothermal LAMP at point-of-care are also now available, reports of isothermal assays at the point-of-care with detection of multiple genes are lacking. Here, we present a microfluidic assay and device to detect and differentiate the Alpha variant (B.1.1.7) from the SARS-CoV-2 virus early strains in saliva samples. The detection assay, which is based on isothermal RT-LAMP amplification, takes advantage of the S-gene target failure (SGTF) to differentiate the Alpha variant from the SARS-CoV-2 virus early strains using a binary detection system based on spatial separation of the primers specific to the N- and S-genes. We use additively manufactured plastic cartridges in a low-cost optical reader system to successfully detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus from saliva samples (positive amplification is detected with concentration ≥10 copies per μL) within 30 min. We demonstrate that our platform can discriminate the B.1.1.7 variant (USA/CA_CDC_5574/2020 isolate) from SARS-CoV-2 negative samples, but also from the SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 isolate. The reliability of the developed point-of-care device was confirmed by testing 38 clinical saliva samples, including 20 samples positive for Alpha variant (sensitivity > 90%, specificity = 100%). This study highlights the current relevance of binary-based testing, as the new Omicron variant also exhibits S-gene target failure and could be tested by adapting the approach presented here.",Lab on a chip,2022,secondary,doi:10.1039/d2lc00021k,35244660,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1039/d2lc00021k,

The World Health Organization (WHO) designated the epidemic a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Humans are at risk from MPXV’s spread, which has raised concerns, particularly in the wake of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. The risk of virus transmission may rise due to the persistence of MPXV on surfaces or in wastewater. The risk of infection may also increase due to insufficient wastewater treatment allowing the virus to survive in the environment. To manage the infection cycle, it is essential to investigate the viral shedding from various lesions, the persistence of MPXV on multiple surfaces, and the length of surface contamination. Environmental contamination may contribute to virus persistence and future infection transmission. The best possible infection control and disinfection techniques depend on this knowledge. It is thought to spread mainly through intimate contact. However, the idea of virus transmission by environmental contamination creates great concern and discussion. There are more cases of environmental surfaces and wastewater contamination.

Here, we report the development of aptamers that effectively interfere with SARS-CoV-2 infection by targeting its spike protein, which plays a pivotal role in host cell entry of the virus through interaction with the viral receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). To develop highly effective aptamers and to understand their mechanism in inhibiting viral infection, we determined the three-dimensional (3D) structures of aptamer/receptor-binding domain (RBD) complexes using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Moreover, we developed bivalent aptamers targeting two distinct regions of the RBD in the spike protein that directly interact with ACE2. One aptamer interferes with the binding of ACE2 by blocking the ACE2-binding site in RBD, and the other aptamer allosterically inhibits ACE2 by binding to a distinct face of RBD. Using the 3D structures of aptamer–RBD complexes, we minimized and optimized these aptamers. By combining the optimized aptamers, we developed a bivalent aptamer that showed a stronger inhibitory effect on virus infection than the component aptamers. This study confirms that the structure-based aptamer-design approach has a high potential in developing antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses.",Molecules,2023,secondary,doi:10.3390/molecules28124645,37375202,10303109,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/molecules28124645,
doi:10.2196/44657,Wastewater Surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 at Long-Term Care Facilities: Mixed Methods Evaluation,"Background Wastewater surveillance provided early indication of COVID-19 in US municipalities. Residents of long-term care facilities (LTCFs) experienced disproportionate morbidity and mortality early in the COVID-19 pandemic. We implemented LTCF building-level wastewater surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 at 6 facilities in Kentucky to provide early warning of SARS-CoV-2 in populations considered vulnerable. Objective This study aims to evaluate the performance of wastewater surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 at LTCFs in Kentucky. Methods We conducted a mixed methods evaluation of wastewater surveillance following Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for evaluating public health surveillance systems. Evaluation steps in the CDC guidelines were engaging stakeholders, describing the surveillance system, focusing the evaluation design, gathering credible evidence, and generating conclusions and recommendations. We purposively recruited stakeholders for semistructured interviews and undertook thematic content analysis of interview data. We integrated wastewater, clinical testing, and process data to characterize or calculate 7 surveillance system performance attributes (simplicity, flexibility, data quality, sensitivity and positive predictive value [PPV], timeliness, representativeness, and stability). Results We conducted 8 stakeholder interviews. The surveillance system collected wastewater samples (N=811) 2 to 4 times weekly at 6 LTCFs in Kentucky from March 2021 to February 2022. Synthesis of credible evidence indicated variable surveillance performance. Regarding simplicity, surveillance implementation required moderate human resource and technical capacity. Regarding flexibility, the system efficiently adjusted surveillance frequency and demonstrated the ability to detect additional pathogens of interest. Regarding data quality, software identified errors in wastewater sample metadata entry (110/3120, 3.53% of fields), technicians identified polymerase chain reaction data issues (140/7734, 1.81% of reactions), and staff entered all data corrections into a log. Regarding sensitivity and PPV, using routine LTCF SARS-CoV-2 clinical testing results as the gold standard, a wastewater SARS-CoV-2 signal of >0 RNA copies/mL was 30.6% (95% CI 24.4%-36.8%) sensitive and 79.7% (95% CI 76.4%-82.9%) specific for a positive clinical test at the LTCF. The PPV of the wastewater signal was 34.8% (95% CI 27.9%-41.7%) at >0 RNA copies/mL and increased to 75% (95% CI 60%-90%) at >250 copies/mL. Regarding timeliness, stakeholders received surveillance data 24 to 72 hours after sample collection, with delayed reporting because of the lack of weekend laboratory staff. Regarding representativeness, stakeholders identified challenges delineating the population contributing to LTCF wastewater because of visitors, unknown staff toileting habits, and the use of adult briefs by some residents preventing their waste from entering the sewer system. Regarding stability, the reoccurring cost to conduct 1 day of wastewater surveillance at 1 facility was approximately US $144.50, which included transportation, labor, and materials expenses. Conclusions The LTCF wastewater surveillance system demonstrated mixed performance per CDC criteria. Stakeholders found surveillance feasible and expressed optimism regarding its potential while also recognizing challenges in interpreting and acting on surveillance data.",JMIR Public Health and Surveillance,2022,secondary,doi:10.2196/44657,37643001,10467632,https://doi.org/doi:10.2196/44657,

We compare self-reporting with home and lab psychophysical “taste strips” tests in healthy subjects. The taste test consisted of paper strips impregnated with sweet, bitter, salty, or sour tastants, and with the trigeminal stimulus capsaicin, each in high and in low concentration. The test was carried out either in a controlled lab environment (74 participants, 47 women) with the strips being administered by the experimenter or self-administered by the participants at home (77 participants, 59 women). After self-reporting their subjective assessment of chemosensory ability, the participant identified the taste of each strip and rated intensity and pleasantness. Identification score, intensity, and pleasantness averaged over the 8 taste strips were similar between the lab and the home-administered tests. Self-rated taste ability did not correlate with any of these scores, but strongly correlated with self-rated smell ability in the lab group (r=0.73), and moderately correlated in the home group (r=0.51). Taste identification correlated with intensity ratings (r=0.63 lab, r=0.36 home) but not with the pleasantness ratings (r=-0.14 lab, r=0.1 home).

doi:10.1093/femsmc/xtac024,Effectiveness of building-level sewage surveillance during both community-spread and sporadic-infection phases of SARS-CoV-2 in a university campus population,"Abstract Pathogen surveillance within wastewater rapidly progressed during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and informed public health management. In addition to the successful monitoring of entire sewer catchment basins at the treatment facility scale, subcatchment or building-level monitoring enabled targeted support of resource deployment. However, optimizing the temporal and spatial resolution of these monitoring programs remains complex due to population dynamics and within-sewer physical, chemical, and biological processes. To address these limitations, this study explores the advancement of the building-scale network that monitored the on-campus residential population at the University of Colorado Boulder between August 2020 and May 2021 through a daily SARS-CoV-2 surveillance campaign. During the study period, SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence transitioned from robust community spread in Fall 2020 to sporadic infections in Spring 2021. Temporally, these distinct phases enabled investigating the effectiveness of resource commitment by exploring subsets of the original daily sampling data. Spatially, select sampling sites were installed along the flow path of the pipe network, enabling the exploration of the conservation of viral concentrations within the wastewater. Infection prevalence and resource commitment for informed action displayed an inverted relationship: higher temporal and spatial resolution surveillance is more imperative during sporadic infection phases than during high prevalence periods. This relationship was reinforced when norovirus (two minor clusters) and influenza (primarily absent) were additionally surveilled at a weekly frequency. Overall, resource commitment should scale to meet the objectives of the monitoring campaign—providing a general prevalence estimate requires fewer resources than an early-warning and targeted-action monitoring framework.",FEMS Microbes,2022,secondary,doi:10.1093/femsmc/xtac024,37332508,10117889,https://doi.org/doi:10.1093/femsmc/xtac024,

MIS-C shares features with Kawasaki disease (KD) and cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) frequently requiring intensive care support. Although intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and glucocorticoids (GCs) are effective therapeutics for most, refractory MIS-C is treated with various biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs). Understanding the clinical features, inflammatory cytokines, and genetic associations provides rationale for bDMARD in treating severe MIS-C. Recent findings Children with MIS-C have clinical KD features and often present in hypovolemic and cardiogenic shock requiring volume repletion (gastrointestinaI losses) and cardiac pressor support (epinephrine). Investigation of MIS-C serum reveals elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-18, interferon gamma (IFNγ), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)], but to a lesser extent than other established CSS. Gene sequencing of MIS-C children identifies heterozygous mutations in CSS associated genes. Treatment of refractory (IVIg and GC) MIS-C with bDMARDs to IL-1, IL-6, and TNF is efficacious for survival as well as resolving cardiac and coronary artery inflammation. Summary MIS-C is a postinfectious complication of SARS-CoV-2 resembling KD and CSS, both genetically and by pro-inflammatory cytokines.

Effective vaccines have now entered the market, but most patient populations were not included in the registration clinical trials. There is evidence that patients with celiac disease (CeD) have reduced effect of vaccines such as the hepatitis B vaccine. Hence, we investigated the humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (Chadox1, Comirnaty and Spikevax) in CeD patients and healthy controls. Methods CeD patients from a patient registry at Oslo University Hospital were invited to donate serum samples before and after vaccination. We sent out 1537 invitations and received paired samples from 85 individuals. These were compared with similar samples from 238 healthy controls. Sera were analyzed for antibodies to the Spike protein from SARS-CoV2 and the receptor-binding domain. The results where then converted into binding antibody units (BAU)/ml to compare. Results Prevaccination samples showed that very few patients had been earlier exposed to Sars-CoV2 and the antibody levels were low. Postvaccination analysis showed overlap of antibody levels between CeD and healthy controls. On average, the CeD patient group had 5555.0 BAU/ml (330.1 SD) while the average in healthy controls was 5419 (184.7 SD). Conclusion The humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in CeD patients is similar to that observed in healthy controls.

Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study on patients who received casirivimab and imdevimab or bamlanivimab for the treatment of mild Covid-19. Results Three hundred forty patients were included in the study with the mean age of the cohort 54.7 ± 17.5 years, and 36.5% of them were men. Thirty-day outcomes revealed that 300 (88.2%) patients were followed up to 30 days, out of which 243 patients (71.5%) were asymptomatic at 30 days, 57 patients (16.7%) had symptoms at 30 days out of which 9 patients (2.6%) had an ED visit or were admitted because of the worsening of Covid-19 in 30 days and 3 patients (0.9%) died.

This systematic review aimed to pool evidence assessing the humoral response of hemodialysis patients (HDP) post-mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. A systematic search of the literature was performed through MEDLINE, CINAHL, PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases, as well as medRxiv and bioRxiv preprint servers up to 10 January 2023. Cohort and case-control studies were included if they reported an immune response in one group of patients undergoing hemodialysis who received mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination compared with another group of patients receiving the same vaccine but not on hemodialysis. The methodological quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Meta-analysis was not deemed appropriate due to the high heterogeneity between studies. From the 120 studies identified, nine (n = 1969 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Most studies (n = 8/9, 88%) were of high or medium methodological quality (≥6/9 stars). The results revealed that HDP developed lower antibody levels across all timepoints post-vaccination when compared with controls. Patients with chronic kidney disease elicited the highest antibody immune response, followed by HDP and, lastly, kidney transplant recipients. Overall, post-vaccination antibody titers were comparatively lower than in the healthy population. Current results imply that robust vaccination strategies are needed to address waning immune responses in vulnerable populations.",Vaccines,2023,secondary,doi:10.3390/vaccines11040724,37112636,10142871,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/vaccines11040724,

In the last 50 years, the built-up area has more than doubled, with a massive biodiversity loss. The undeniable benefits of a city providing all the basic needs to a growing population showed longer-term and less obvious costs to human health: autoimmune and non-communicable diseases, as well as antimicrobial resistance, have reached unprecedented and alarming levels. Humans coevolved with microbes, and this long-lasting alliance is affected by the loss of connection with natural environments, misuse of antibiotics, and highly sanitized environments. Our aim is to direct the focus onto the microbial communities harbored by the built environments we live in. They represent the nexus for urban regeneration, which starts from a healthy environment. Planning a city means considering, in a two-fold way, the ecosystem health and the multidimensional aspects of wellbeing, including social, cultural, and aesthetic values. The significance of this perspective is inspiring guidelines and strategies for the urban regeneration of the cities of tomorrow, exploiting the invaluable role of microbial biodiversity and the ecosystem services that it could provide to create the robust scientific knowledge that is necessary for a bioinformed design of buildings and cities for healthy and sustainable living.",Microorganisms,2022,secondary,doi:10.3390/microorganisms10122311,36557564,9783557,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/microorganisms10122311,

doi:10.1101/2023.12.13.571553,Personalized Pangenome References,"Pangenomes, by including genetic diversity, should reduce reference bias by better representing new samples compared to them. Yet when comparing a new sample to a pangenome, variants in the pangenome that are not part of the sample can be misleading, for example, causing false read mappings. These irrelevant variants are generally rarer in terms of allele frequency, and have previously been dealt with using allele frequency filters. However, this is a blunt heuristic that both fails to remove some irrelevant variants and removes many relevant variants. We propose a new approach, inspired by local ancestry inference methods, that imputes a personalized pangenome subgraph based on sampling local haplotypes according to k-mer counts in the reads. Our approach is tailored for the Giraffe short read aligner, as the indexes it needs for read mapping can be built quickly. We compare the accuracy of our approach to state-of-the-art methods using graphs from the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium. The resulting personalized pangenome pipelines provide faster pangenome read mapping than comparable pipelines that use a linear reference, reduce small variant genotyping errors by 4x relative to the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) best-practice pipeline, and for the first time make short-read structural variant genotyping competitive with long-read discovery methods.",bioRxiv,2023,secondary,doi:10.1101/2023.12.13.571553,38168361,10760139,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2023.12.13.571553,

Current gold-standard antimicrobial susceptibility tests (ASTs) are low-throughput and can take up to 48 hours, with implications for patient care. We present advances towards a novel, rapid AST, based on the deep-learning of single-cell specific phenotypes directly associated with antimicrobial susceptibility in Escherichia coli. Our models can reliably (80% single-cell accuracy) classify untreated and treated susceptible cells, across a range of antibiotics and phenotypes - including phenotypes not visually distinct to a trained, human observer. Applying models trained on lab-reference susceptible strains to clinical isolates of E. coli treated with ciprofloxacin, we demonstrate our models reveal significant (p<0.001) differences between resistant and susceptible populations, around a fixed treatment level. Conversely, deploying on cells treated with a range of ciprofloxacin concentrations, we show single-cell phenotyping has the potential to provide equivalent information to a 24-hour growth AST assay, but in as little as 30 minutes.",,2022,secondary,doi:10.1101/2022.12.08.22283219,,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2022.12.08.22283219,

We investigated the mucosal host gene response at the time of gold standard COVID-19 diagnosis using clinical surplus RNA from upper respiratory tract swabs. Methods Host response was evaluated by RNA-sequencing, and transcriptomic profiles of 44 unvaccinated patients including outpatients and in-patients with varying levels of oxygen supplementation were included. Additionally, chest X-rays were reviewed and scored for patients in each group. Results Host transcriptomics revealed significant changes in the immune and inflammatory response. Patients destined for the ICU were distinguished by the significant upregulation of immune response pathways and inflammatory chemokines, including cxcl2 which has been linked to monocyte subsets associated with COVID-19 related lung damage. In order to temporally associate gene expression profiles in the upper respiratory tract at diagnosis of COVID-19 with lower respiratory tract sequalae, we correlated our findings with chest radiography scoring, showing nasopharygeal or mid-turbinate sampling can be a relevant surrogate for downstream COVID-19 pneumonia/ICU severity. Conclusions This study demonstrates the potential and relevance for ongoing study of the mucosal site of infection of SARS-CoV-2 using a single sampling that remains standard of care in hospital settings. We highlight also the archival value of high quality clinical surplus specimens, especially with rapidly evolving COVID-19 variants and changing public health/vaccination measures.",Open Forum Infectious Diseases,2023,secondary,doi:10.1093/ofid/ofad190,37180592,10173546,https://doi.org/doi:10.1093/ofid/ofad190,

However, natural cytoskeletal components can be difficult to purify, deliberately engineer and reconstitute within synthetic cells which therefore limits the realization of multifaceted functions of modern cytoskeletons in synthetic cells. Here, we review recent progress in the development of synthetic cytoskeletons made from deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) as a complementary strategy. In particular, we explore the capabilities and limitations of DNA cytoskeletons to mimic functions of natural cystoskeletons like reversible assembly, cargo transport, force generation, mechanical support and guided polymerization. With recent examples, we showcase the power of rationally designed DNA cytoskeletons for bottom-up assembled synthetic cells as fully engineerable entities. Nevertheless, the realization of dynamic instability, self-replication and genetic encoding as well as contractile force generating motors remains a fruitful challenge for the complete integration of multifunctional DNA-based cytoskeletons into synthetic cells.",Interface Focus,2023,secondary,doi:10.1098/rsfs.2023.0028,37577007,10415745,https://doi.org/doi:10.1098/rsfs.2023.0028,

 Background High resolution, strong contrast and multimodality visualization of live mammalian embryo is an important requirement for studying foetal development. Photoacoustic Tomography (PAT) and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) are two advanced imaging modalities that has been utilized for embryonic imaging. However, high contrast, multiscale and deep tissue visualization of live embryos remains challenging. Results Here, we demonstrate the use of gold nanostars (GNS) as multimodality contrast agents for the visualization and differentiation of embryos in vivo using NIR-I PAT and NIR-II OCT. We perform NIR-I PAT imaging to confirm in vivo GNS accumulation in the foetuses, and then use a customized NIR-II OCT system to further reveal deep, contrast-enhanced micro features of freshly harvested embryos. We investigate two different GNS administration pathways, i.e. intravenous and intravaginal injection, and significant enhancement of signal, image contrast, and imaging depth are achieved for both PAT and OCT. Conclusions These findings prove that PAT-OCT bi-modal imaging with GNS enhancement provides more accurate structural characteristic of live mammalian embryos, and thus reveal its potential for embryonic development visualization and early abnormality examination.

Current targeted PGx testing platforms are mainly based on microarray, polymerase chain reaction, or short-read sequencing. Despite demonstrating great value for the identification of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertion/deletions (INDELs), these assays do not permit identification of large structural variants, nor do they allow unambiguous haplotype phasing for star-allele assignment. Here, we used Oxford Nanopore Technologies’ adaptive sampling to enrich a panel of 1,036 genes with well-documented PGx relevance extracted from the Pharmacogenomics Knowledge Base (PharmGKB). By evaluating concordance with existing truth sets, we demonstrate accurate variant and star-allele calling for five Genome in a Bottle reference samples. We show that up to three samples can be multiplexed on one PromethION flow cell without a significant drop in variant calling performance, resulting in 99.35% and 99.84% recall and precision for the targeted variants, respectively.

While the concerning variants are fast spreading in various geographical areas, identification and monitoring of these variants are lagging far behind, due in large part to the slow speed and insufficient capacity of viral sequencing. In response to the unmet need for a fast and efficient screening tool, we developed a single-tube duplex molecular assay for rapid and simultaneous identification of E484K and N501Y mutations from nasopharyngeal swab (NS) samples within 2.5 h from sample preparation to report. Using this tool, we screened a total of 1135 clinical NS samples collected from COVID patients at 8 hospitals within the Hackensack Meridian Health network in New Jersey between late December 2020 and March 2021. Our data revealed dramatic increases in the frequencies of both E484K and N501Y over time, underscoring the need for continuous epidemiological monitoring.",Emerging Microbes & Infections,2021,secondary,doi:10.1080/22221751.2021.1929504,33977858,8168736,https://doi.org/doi:10.1080/22221751.2021.1929504,

We developed a sensitive spectroscopic sensor for simultaneous δ13C, δ18O, and δ17O analysis of human breath CO2 based on mid-infrared laser direct absorption spectroscopy with an interband cascade laser (ICL) at 4.33 μm. There was a gas cell with a small volume of less than 5 mL, and the pressure in the gas cell was precisely controlled with a standard deviation of 0.0035 Torr. Moreover, real-time breath sampling and batch operation were achieved in gas inlets. The theoretical drifts for δ13C, δ18O, and δ17O measurement caused by temperature were minimized to 0.017‰, 0.024‰, and 0.021‰, respectively, thanks to the precise temperature control with a standard deviation of 0.0013 °C. After absolute temperature correction, the error between the system responded δ-value and the reference is less than 0.3‰. According to Allan variance analysis, the system precisions for δ13C, δ18O, and δ17O were 0.12‰, 0.18‰, and 0.47‰, respectively, at 1 s integration time, which were close to the real-time measurement errors of six repeated exhalations.","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,secondary,doi:10.3390/s22041527,35214432,8877011,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/s22041527,
