doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0290256,A capacitive laser-induced graphene based aptasensor for SARS-CoV-2 detection in human saliva.,"SARS-CoV-2 virus induced CoVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the development of diagnostic tools. Devices integrated with electrochemical biosensors may be an interesting alternative to respond to the high demand for testing, particularly in contexts where access to standard detection technologies is lacking. Aptamers as recognition elements are useful due to their stability, specificity, and sensitivity to binding target molecules. We have developed a non-invasive electrochemical aptamer-based biosensor targeting SARS-CoV-2 in human saliva. The aptamer is expected to detect the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 wildtype and its variants. Laser-induced graphene (LIG) electrodes coated with platinum nanoparticles were biofunctionalized with a biotin-tagged aptamer. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) for BA.1 sensing was conducted in sodium chloride/sodium bicarbonate solution supplemented with pooled saliva. To estimate sensing performance, the aptasensor was tested with contrived samples of UV-attenuated virions from 10 to 10,000 copies/ml. Selectivity was assessed by exposing the aptasensor to non-targeted viruses (hCoV-OC43, Influenza A, and RSV-A). EIS data outputs were further used to select a suitable response variable and cutoff frequency. Capacitance increases in response to the gradual loading of the attenuated BA.1. The aptasensor was sensitive and specific for BA.1 at a lower viral load (10-100 copies/ml) and was capable of discriminating between negative and positive contrived samples (with strain specificity against other viruses: OC43, Influenza A, and RSV-A). The aptasensor detected SARS-CoV-2 with an estimated LOD of 1790 copies/ml in contrived samples. In human clinical samples, the aptasensor presents an accuracy of 72%, with 75% of positive percent of agreement and 67% of negative percent of agreement. Our results show that the aptasensor is a promising candidate to detect SARS-CoV-2 during early stages of infection when virion concentrations are low, which may be useful for preventing the asymptomatic spread of CoVID-19.",PloS one,2023,primary,doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0290256,37590297,PMC10434860,https://doi.org/doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0290256
doi:10.3390/bios12110938,An Experimental Framework for Developing Point-of-Need Biosensors: Connecting Bio-Layer Interferometry and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy.,"Biolayer interferometry (BLI) is a well-established laboratory technique for studying biomolecular interactions important for applications such as drug development. Currently, there are interesting opportunities for expanding the use of BLI in other fields, including the development of rapid diagnostic tools. To date, there are no detailed frameworks for implementing BLI in target-recognition studies that are pivotal for developing point-of-need biosensors. Here, we attempt to bridge these domains by providing a framework that connects output(s) of molecular interaction studies with key performance indicators used in the development of point-of-need biosensors. First, we briefly review the governing theory for protein-ligand interactions, and we then summarize the approach for real-time kinetic quantification using various techniques. The 2020 PRISMA guideline was used for all governing theory reviews and meta-analyses. Using the information from the meta-analysis, we introduce an experimental framework for connecting outcomes from BLI experiments (KD, kon, koff) with electrochemical (capacitive) biosensor design. As a first step in the development of a larger framework, we specifically focus on mapping BLI outcomes to five biosensor key performance indicators (sensitivity, selectivity, response time, hysteresis, operating range). The applicability of our framework was demonstrated in a study of case based on published literature related to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to show the development of a capacitive biosensor based on truncated angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor. The case study focuses on non-specific binding and selectivity as research goals. The proposed framework proved to be an important first step toward modeling/simulation efforts that map molecular interactions to sensor design.",Biosensors,2022,primary,doi:10.3390/bios12110938,36354449,PMC9688365,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/bios12110938
doi:10.3389/fsens.2022.917380,Development of a Biosensor Based on Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme II for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Detection in Human Saliva.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the novel coronavirus responsible for COVID-19. Infection in humans requires angiotensin-converting enzyme II (hACE2) as the point of entry for SARS-CoV-2. PCR testing is generally definitive but expensive, although it is highly sensitive and accurate. Biosensor-based monitoring could be a low-cost, accurate, and non-invasive approach to improve testing capacity. We develop a capacitive hACE2 biosensor for intact SARS-CoV-2 detection in saliva. Laser-induced graphene (LIG) electrodes were modified with platinum nanoparticles. The quality control of LIG electrodes was performed using cyclic voltammetry. Truncated hACE2 was used as a biorecognition element and attached to the electrode surface by streptavidin-biotin coupling. Biolayer interferometry was used for qualitative interaction screening of hACE2 with UV-attenuated virions. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used for signal transduction. Truncated hACE2 binds wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and its variants with greater avidity than human coronavirus (common cold virus). The limit of detection (LoD) is estimated to be 2,960 copies/ml. The detection process usually takes less than 30 min. The strength of these features makes the hACE2 biosensor a potentially low-cost approach for screening SARS-CoV-2 in non-clinical settings with high demand for rapid testing (for example, schools and airports).",Frontiers in sensors,2022,primary,doi:10.3389/fsens.2022.917380,35992634,PMC9386735,https://doi.org/doi:10.3389/fsens.2022.917380

doi:10.1021/acssensors.3c00512,Rapid Direct Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Aerosols in Exhaled Breath at the Point of Care.,"Airborne transmission via virus-laden aerosols is a dominant route for the transmission of respiratory diseases, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Direct, non-invasive screening of respiratory virus aerosols in patients has been a long-standing technical challenge. Here, we introduce a point-of-care testing platform that directly detects SARS-CoV-2 aerosols in as little as two exhaled breaths of patients and provides results in under 60 s. It integrates a hand-held breath aerosol collector and a llama-derived, SARS-CoV-2 spike-protein specific nanobody bound to an ultrasensitive micro-immunoelectrode biosensor, which detects the oxidation of tyrosine amino acids present in SARS-CoV-2 viral particles. Laboratory and clinical trial results were within 20% of those obtained using standard testing methods. Importantly, the electrochemical biosensor directly detects the virus itself, as opposed to a surrogate or signature of the virus, and is sensitive to as little as 10 viral particles in a sample. Our platform holds the potential to be adapted for multiplexed detection of different respiratory viruses. It provides a rapid and non-invasive alternative to conventional viral diagnostics.",ACS sensors,2023,primary,doi:10.1021/acssensors.3c00512,37498298,PMC10463275,https://doi.org/doi:10.1021/acssensors.3c00512

Offline air sampling techniques for SARS-CoV-2 detection suffer from longer turnaround times and require skilled labor. Here, we present a proof-of-concept pathogen Air Quality (pAQ) monitor for real-time (5 min time resolution) direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 aerosols. The system synergistically integrates a high flow (~1000 lpm) wet cyclone air sampler and a nanobody-based ultrasensitive micro-immunoelectrode biosensor. The wet cyclone showed comparable or better virus sampling performance than commercially available samplers. Laboratory experiments demonstrate a device sensitivity of 77-83% and a limit of detection of 7-35 viral RNA copies/m3 of air. Our pAQ monitor is suited for point-of-need surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 variants in indoor environments and can be adapted for multiplexed detection of other respiratory pathogens of interest. Widespread adoption of such technology could assist public health officials with implementing rapid disease control measures.",Nature communications,2023,primary,doi:10.1038/s41467-023-39419-z,37429842,PMC10333287,https://doi.org/doi:10.1038/s41467-023-39419-z

Here we present Rolosense, a virus sensing platform that transduces the motion of synthetic DNA-based motors transporting 5-micron particles on RNA fuel chips. Motors and chips are modified with virus-binding aptamers that lead to stalling of motion. Therefore, motors perform a ""mechanical test"" of viral target and stall in the presence of whole virions which represents a unique mechanism of transduction distinct from conventional assays. Rolosense can detect SARS-CoV-2 spiked in artificial saliva and exhaled breath condensate with a sensitivity of 10 3 copies/mL and discriminates among other respiratory viruses. The assay is modular and amenable to multiplexing, as we demonstrated one-pot detection of influenza A and SARS-CoV-2. As a proof-of-concept, we show readout can be achieved using a smartphone camera in as little as 15 mins without any sample preparation steps. Taken together, mechanical detection using Rolosense can be broadly applied to any viral target and has the potential to enable rapid, low-cost, point-of-care screening of circulating viruses.",bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,2023,primary,doi:10.1101/2023.02.27.530294,36909543,PMC10002644,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2023.02.27.530294

In general, DNA computation is conducted in individual tubes, is slow in generating chemical outputs in response to chemical inputs and requires fluorescence readout. Here, we introduce a new paradigm for DNA computation where the chemical input is processed and transduced into a mechanical output using dynamic DNA-based motors operating far from equilibrium. We show that DNA-based motors with onboard logic (DMOLs) can perform Boolean functions (NOT, YES, AND and OR) with 15 min readout times. Because DMOLs are micrometre-sized, massive arrays of DMOLs that are identical or uniquely encoded by size and refractive index can be multiplexed and perform motor-to-motor communication on the same chip. Finally, DMOL computational outputs can be detected using a conventional smartphone camera, thus transducing chemical information into the electronic domain in a facile manner, suggesting potential applications.",Nature nanotechnology,2022,primary,doi:10.1038/s41565-022-01080-w,35347272,PMC9119907,https://doi.org/doi:10.1038/s41565-022-01080-w

Programmable MAMs are a subset of responsive materials and offer potential in next generation robotics and smart systems. This review specifically focuses on hydrogel-based MAMs because of their mechanical compliance, programmability, biocompatibility, and cost-efficiency. First, the composition of hydrogel MAMs along with the top-down and bottom-up approaches used for programming these materials are discussed. Next, the fundamental principles for engineering responsivity in MAMS, which includes optical, thermal, magnetic, electrical, chemical, and mechanical stimuli, are considered. Some advantages and disadvantages of different responsivities are compared. Then, to conclude, the emerging applications of hydrogel-based MAMs from recently published literature, as well as the future outlook of MAM studies, are summarized.","Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",2021,primary,doi:10.1002/adma.202006600,34309076,PMC8595730,https://doi.org/doi:10.1002/adma.202006600
doi:10.1002/anie.202107660,Mechanically Triggered Hybridization Chain Reaction.,"Cells transmit piconewton forces to receptors to mediate processes such as migration and immune recognition. A major challenge in quantifying such forces is the sparsity of cell mechanical events. Accordingly, molecular tension is typically quantified with high resolution fluorescence microscopy, which hinders widespread adoption and application. Here, we report a mechanically triggered hybridization chain reaction (mechano-HCR) that allows chemical amplification of mechanical events. The amplification is triggered when a cell receptor mechanically denatures a duplex revealing a cryptic initiator to activate the HCR reaction in situ. Importantly, mechano-HCR enables direct readout of pN forces using a plate reader. We leverage this capability and measured mechano-IC50 for aspirin, Y-27632, and eptifibatide.

Recently, aptamers have garnered increased interest due to their unique properties, including inexpensive production, simple chemical modification, and long-term stability. At the same time, aptamers possess similar binding affinity and specificity as their protein counterpart. In this review, we discuss the aptamer discovery process as well as aptamer applications to biosensors and separations. In the discovery section, we describe the major steps of the library selection process for aptamers, called systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX). We highlight common approaches and emerging strategies in SELEX, from starting library selection to aptamer-target binding characterization. In the applications section, we first evaluate recently developed aptamer biosensors for SARS-CoV-2 virus detection, including electrochemical aptamer-based sensors and lateral flow assays. Then we discuss aptamer-based separations for partitioning different molecules or cell types, especially for purifying T cell subsets for therapeutic applications.

Many antibodies and aptamers that bind the spike (S) of previous strains of SARS-CoV-2 either do not bind or bind with low affinity to Omicron S. In this study, we report a high-affinity SARS-CoV-2 Omicron RBD-binding aptamer (SCORe) that binds Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 RBD with nanomolar KD1. We employ aptamers SCORe.50 and SNAP4.74 in a multiplexed lateral flow assay (LFA) to distinguish between Omicron and wild-type S at concentrations as low as 100 pM. Finally, we show that SCORe.50 and its dimerized form SCOReD can neutralize Omicron S-pseudotyped virus infection of ACE2-overexpressing cells by >70%.

Although COVID-19 vaccines are being distributed, there remains a need for rapid testing to limit viral spread from infected individuals. We previously identified the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein N-terminal domain (NTD) binding DNA aptamer 1 (SNAP1) for detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus by aptamer-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) and lateral flow assay (LFA). In this work, we identify a new aptamer that also binds at the NTD, named SARS-CoV-2 spike protein NTD-binding DNA aptamer 4 (SNAP4). SNAP4 binds with high affinity (<30 nM) for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, a 2-fold improvement over SNAP1. Furthermore, we utilized both SNAP1 and SNAP4 in an aptamer sandwich LFA (AptaFlow), which detected SARS-CoV-2 UV-inactivated virus at concentrations as low as 106 copies/mL. AptaFlow costs <$1 per test to produce, provides results in <1 h, and detects SARS-CoV-2 at concentrations that indicate higher viral loads and a high probability of contagious transmission.

Here, we report the design and characterization of a compact fluorimeter called a ""Virus Pod"" (V-Pod) that enables sensitive self-testing of SARS-CoV-2 viral load in saliva. The rechargeable battery-operated device reads the fluorescence generated by Designer DNA Nanostructures (DDN) when they specifically interact with intact SARS-CoV-2 virions. DDNs are net-shaped self-assembling nucleic acid constructs that provide an array of highly specific aptamer-fluorescent quencher duplexes located at precise positions that match the pattern of spike proteins. The room-temperature assay is performed by mixing the test sample with DNA Net sensor in a conventional PCR tube and placing the tube into the V-Pod. Fluorescent signals are generated when multivalent aptamer-spike binding releases fluorescent quenchers, resulting in rapid (5-min) generation of dose-dependent output. The V-Pod instrument performs laser excitation, fluorescence intensity quantitation, and secure transmission of data to an App via Bluetooth™. We show that the V-Pod and DNA Net assay achieves clinically relevant detection limits of 3.92 × 103 viral-genome-copies/mL for pseudo-typed wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and 1.84 × 104, 9.69 × 104, 6.99 × 104 viral-genome-copies/mL for pathogenic Delta, Omicron, and D614G variants, representing sensitivity similar to laboratory-based PCR.

The contrast of interferometric scattering microscopy is amplified through a photonic crystal surface, upon which scattered light from an object combines with illumination from a monochromatic source. The use of a photonic crystal substrate for interferemetric scattering microscopy results in reduced requirements for high-intensity lasers or oil-immersion objectives, thus opening a pathway toward instruments that are more suitable for environments outside the optics laboratory. The instrument incorporates two innovative elements that facilitate operation on a desktop in ordinary laboratory environments by users that do not have optics expertise. First, because scattering microscopes are extremely sensitive to vibration, we incorporated an inexpensive but effective solution of suspending the instrument's main components from a rigid metal framework using elastic bands, resulting in an average of 28.7 dBV reduction in vibration amplitude compared to an office desk.

Central to our ability to successfully tackle these diseases is the need to quickly detect the causative virus and neutralize it efficiently. Here we present the rational design of DNA nanostructures to inhibit dengue virus infection. The designer DNA nanostructure (DDN) can bind to complementary epitopes on antigens dispersed across the surface of a viral particle. Since these antigens are arranged in a defined geometric pattern that is unique to each virus, the structure of the DDN is designed to mirror the spatial arrangement of antigens on the viral particle, providing very high viral binding avidity. We describe how available structural data can be used to identify unique spatial patterns of antigens on the surface of a viral particle. We then present a procedure for synthesizing DDNs using a combination of in silico design principles, self-assembly, and characterization using gel electrophoresis, atomic force microscopy and surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy. Finally, we evaluate the efficacy of a DDN in inhibiting dengue virus infection via plaque-forming assays.

Meanwhile, widespread commercial availability of new test kits continues to be hampered by the cost and time required to develop single-use disposable microfluidic plastic cartridges manufactured by injection molding. Through development of novel technologies for sensitive, selective, rapid, and robust viral detection and more efficient approaches for scalable manufacturing of microfluidic devices, we can be much better prepared for future management of infectious pathogen outbreaks. Here, we describe how photonic metamaterials, graphene nanomaterials, designer DNA nanostructures, and polymers amenable to scalable additive manufacturing are being applied towards overcoming the fundamental limitations of currently dominant COVID-19 diagnostic approaches. In this paper, we review how several distinct classes of nanomaterials and nanochemistry enable simple assay workflows, high sensitivity, inexpensive instrumentation, point-of-care sample-to-answer virus diagnosis, and rapidly scaled manufacturing.",Current opinion in solid state & materials science,2022,primary,doi:10.1016/j.cossms.2021.100966,34840515,PMC8604633,https://doi.org/doi:10.1016/j.cossms.2021.100966

However, this can contribute to excess sodium intake and a poor diet. Capsaicin may help increase salt taste intensity and eating enjoyment in this population, but this has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to determine 1) whether salt intake in those with smell loss differs from population averages, 2) whether capsaicin increases flavor and salt taste intensity, and 3) if adding spice to foods increases food liking in individuals with smell loss. Participants 18-65 years old with confirmed partial or total smell loss for at least 12 weeks completed two sets of replicate test sessions (four total). In two sessions participants rated overall flavor intensity, taste qualities' intensities, spicy intensity, and liking for model tomato soups with low or regular sodium content and three levels of capsaicin (none, low, or moderate). In the other two sessions, participants rated the same sensory attributes for model food samples with three levels of added spice (none, low, or moderate). 24-hour urine samples were also collected to determine sodium intake. Results indicate that although sodium intake is higher than recommended in those with smell loss (2893 ± 258 mg/day), they do not consume more sodium than population averages. Adding low and moderate amounts of capsaicin to a model tomato soup increased the intensity of overall flavor and saltiness compared to a model tomato soup without capsaicin. However, the effect of capsaicin on liking differed by food type. In conclusion, the addition of capsaicin can improve flavor, salt taste intensity, and eating enjoyment in people with smell loss.",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,2023,primary,doi:10.1101/2023.06.05.23290966,37333099,PMC10275002,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2023.06.05.23290966

To address this need, we developed the SCENTinel 1.0 test, which rapidly evaluates 3 olfactory functions: detection, intensity, and identification. We tested whether self-administering the SCENTinel 1.0 test discriminates between individuals with self-reported smell loss and those with average smell ability (normosmic individuals) and provides performance comparable to the validated and standardized NIH Toolbox Odor Identification Test in normosmic individuals. Using Bayesian linear models and prognostic classification algorithms, we compared the SCENTinel 1.0 performance of a group of self-reported anosmic individuals (N = 111, 47 ± 13 years old, F = 71%) and normosmic individuals (N = 154, 47 ± 14 years old, F = 74%) as well as individuals reporting other smell disorders (such as hyposmia or parosmia; N = 42, 55 ± 10 years old, F = 67%). Ninety-four percent of normosmic individuals met our SCENTinel 1.0 accuracy criteria compared with only 10% of anosmic individuals and 64% of individuals with other smell disorders. Overall performance on SCENTinel 1.0 predicted belonging to the normosmic group better than identification or detection alone (vs. anosmic: AUC = 0.95, specificity = 0.94). Odor intensity provided the best single-feature predictor to classify normosmic individuals. Among normosmic individuals, 92% met the accuracy criteria at both SCENTinel 1.0 and the NIH Toolbox Odor Identification Test. SCENTinel 1.0 is a practical test able to discriminate individuals with smell loss and will likely be useful in many clinical situations, including COVID-19 symptom screening.",Chemical senses,2021,primary,doi:10.1093/chemse/bjab012,33773496,PMC8083606,https://doi.org/doi:10.1093/chemse/bjab012

Loss of taste is possible but rare with these illnesses, and patient reports of 'taste loss' typically arise from a taste / flavor confusion. Thus, initial reports from COVID-19 patients of loss of taste and chemesthesis (i.e., chemical somatosensation like warming or cooling) were met with skepticism until multiple studies confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections could disrupt these senses. Many studies have been based on self-report or on single time point assessments after acute illness was ended. Here, we describe intensive longitudinal data over 28 days from adults aged 18-45 years recruited in early 2021 (i.e., prior to the Delta and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 waves). These individuals were either COVID-19 positive or close contacts (per U.S. CDC criteria at the time of the study) in the first half of 2021. Upon enrollment, all participants were given nose clips, blinded samples of commercial jellybeans (Sour Cherry and Cinnamon), and scratch-n-sniff odor identification test cards (ScentCheckPro), which they used for daily assessments. In COVID-19 cases who enrolled on or before Day 10 of infection, Gaussian Process Regression showed two distinct measures of function - odor identification and odor intensity - declined relative to controls (exposed individuals who never developed COVID-19). Because enrollment began upon exposure, some participants became ill only after enrollment, which allowed us to capture baseline ratings, onset of loss, and recovery. Data from these four cases and four age- and sex- matched controls were plotted over 28 days to create panel plots. Variables included mean orthonasal intensity of four odors (ScentCheckPro), perceived nasal blockage, oral burn (Cinnamon jellybeans), and sourness and sweetness (Sour Cherry jellybeans). Controls exhibited stable ratings over time. By contrast, COVID-19 cases showed sharp deviations over time. Changes in odor intensity or odor identification were not explained by nasal blockage. No single pattern of taste loss or recovery was apparent, implying different taste qualities might recover at different rates. Oral burn was transiently reduced for some before recovering quickly, suggesting acute loss may be missed in datasets collected only after illness ends. Collectively, intensive daily testing shows orthonasal smell, oral chemesthesis and taste were each altered by acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Our pre-registered cross-sectional study design included an online survey in 12 languages with instructions for self-administering chemosensory tests with 10 household items. Between June 2020 and March 2021, 10,953 individuals participated. Of these, 5,225 self-reported a respiratory illness and were grouped based on their reported COVID test results: COVID-positive (COVID+, N = 3,356), COVID-negative (COVID-, N = 602), and COVID unknown for those waiting for a test result (COVID?, N = 1,267). The participants who reported no respiratory illness were grouped by symptoms: sudden smell/taste changes (STC, N = 4,445), other symptoms excluding smell or taste changes (OthS, N = 832), and no symptoms (NoS, N = 416). Taste, smell, and oral irritation intensities and self-assessed abilities were rated on visual analog scales. Compared to the NoS group, COVID+ was associated with a 21% reduction in taste (95% confidence interval (CI): 15-28%), 47% in smell (95% CI: 37-56%), and 17% in oral irritation (95% CI: 10-25%) intensity. There were medium to strong correlations between perceived intensities and self-reported abilities (r = 0.84 for smell, r = 0.68 for taste, and r = 0.37 for oral irritation). Our study demonstrates that COVID-19-positive individuals report taste dysfunction when self-tested with stimuli that have little to none olfactory components. Assessing the smell and taste intensity of household items is a promising, cost-effective screening tool that complements self-reports and may help to disentangle taste loss from smell loss.

For example, tests that measure the ability to identify odors may confound sensory performance with memory recall, verbal ability, and prior experience with the odor. Conversely, classic threshold-based tests avoid these issues, but are labor intensive. Additionally, many commercially available tests are slow and may require a trained administrator, making them impractical for use in situations where time is at a premium or self-administration is required. We tested the performance of the Adaptive Olfactory Measure of Threshold (ArOMa-T)-a novel odor detection threshold test that employs an adaptive Bayesian algorithm paired with a disposable odorant delivery card-in a non-clinical sample of individuals (n = 534) at the 2021 Twins Day Festival in Twinsburg, OH. Participants successfully completed the test in under 3 min with a false alarm rate of 7.5% and a test-retest reliability of 0.61. Odor detection thresholds differed by sex (~3.2-fold lower for females) and age (~8.7-fold lower for the youngest versus the oldest age group), consistent with prior studies. In an exploratory analysis, we failed to observe evidence of detection threshold differences between participants who reported a history of COVID-19 and matched controls who did not. We also found evidence for broad-sense heritability of odor detection thresholds. Together, this study suggests the ArOMa-T can determine odor detection thresholds. Additional validation studies are needed to confirm the value of ArOMa-T in clinical or field settings where rapid and portable assessment of olfactory function is needed.",Chemical senses,2022,primary,doi:10.1093/chemse/bjac036,36469087,PMC9798529,https://doi.org/doi:10.1093/chemse/bjac036

Here in Chemical Senses, the Ray lab reports using a predictive modeling framework-first breaking molecular structure into thousands of features and then using this to train a predictive statistical model on a wide range of perceptual descriptors-to create a tool for predicting the odor character of hundreds of thousands of available but previously uncharacterized molecules (Kowalewski et al. 2021). This will allow future investigators to representatively sample the space of odorous molecules as well as identify previously unknown odorants with a target odor character.

Genetic manipulations that delete or inactivate the translin/trax microRNA-degrading enzyme confer protection against aortic stiffness induced by chronic ingestion of high-salt water (4%NaCl in drinking water for 3 weeks) or associated with aging. Therefore, there is heightened interest in identifying interventions capable of inhibiting translin/trax RNase activity, as these may have therapeutic efficacy in large-artery stiffness. Methods and Results Activation of neuronal adenosine A2A receptors (A2ARs) triggers dissociation of trax from its C-terminus. As A2ARs are expressed by vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), we investigated whether stimulation of A2AR on vascular smooth muscle cells promotes the association of translin with trax and, thereby increases translin/trax complex activity. We found that treatment of A7r5 cells with the A2AR agonist CGS21680 leads to increased association of trax with translin. Furthermore, this treatment decreases levels of pre-microRNA-181b, a target of translin/trax, and those of its downstream product, mature microRNA-181b. To check whether A2AR activation might contribute to high-salt water-induced aortic stiffening, we assessed the impact of daily treatment with the selective A2AR antagonist SCH58261 in this paradigm. We found that this treatment blocked aortic stiffening induced by high-salt water. Further, we confirmed that the age-associated decline in aortic pre-microRNA-181b/microRNA-181b levels observed in mice also occurs in humans. Conclusions These findings suggest that further studies are warranted to evaluate whether blockade of A2ARs may have therapeutic potential in treating large-artery stiffness.",Journal of the American Heart Association,2023,primary,doi:10.1161/JAHA.122.028421,37421280,PMC10382090,https://doi.org/doi:10.1161/JAHA.122.028421
doi:10.1152/ajpheart.00250.2022,Contribution of skeletal muscle-specific microRNA-133b to insulin resistance in heart failure.,"Insulin resistance (IR) is one of the hallmarks of heart failure (HF). Abnormalities in skeletal muscle (SM) metabolism have been identified in patients with HF. However, the underlying mechanisms of IR development in SM in HF are poorly understood. Herein, we hypothesize that HF upregulates miR-133b in SM and in turn alters glucose metabolism and the propensity toward IR. Mitochondria isolated from SM of mice with HF induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC) showed lower respiration and downregulation of muscle-specific components of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, AMP deaminase 1 (AMPD1), and fumarate compared with those from control animals. RNA-Seq and subsequent qPCR validation confirmed upregulation of SM-specific microRNA (miRNA), miR-133b, in TAC versus sham animals. miR-133b overexpression alone resulted in significantly lower mitochondrial respiration, cellular glucose uptake, and glycolysis along with lower ATP production and cellular energy reserve compared with the scramble (Scr) in C2C12 cells. miR-133b binds to the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of KLF15, the transcription factor for the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter, GLUT4. Overexpression of miR-133b lowers GLUT4 and lowers pAkt in presence of insulin in C2C12 cells. Finally, lowering miR-133b in primary skeletal myocytes isolated from TAC mice using antagomir-133b reversed the changes in KLF15, GLUT4, and AMPD1 compared with the scramble-transfected myocytes. Taken together, these data demonstrate a role for SM miR-133b in altered glucose metabolism in HF and suggest the therapeutic potential in HF to improve glucose uptake and glycolysis by restoring GLUT4 abundance. The data uncover a novel mechanism for IR and ultimately SM metabolic abnormalities in patients with HF.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Heart failure is associated with systemic insulin resistance and abnormalities in glucose metabolism but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In the skeletal muscle, the major peripheral site of glucose utilization, we observe an increase in miR-133b in heart failure mice, which reduces the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter (GLUT4), glucose uptake, and metabolism in C2C12 and in myocytes. The antagomir for miR-133b restores GLUT4 protein and markers of metabolism in skeletal myocytes from heart failure mice demonstrating that miR-133b is an exciting target for systemic insulin resistance in heart failure and an important player in the cross talk between the heart and the periphery in the heart failure syndrome.",American journal of physiology.

doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0256973,Role of miR-181c in Diet-induced obesity through regulation of lipid synthesis in liver.,"We recently identified a nuclear-encoded miRNA (miR-181c) in cardiomyocytes that can translocate into mitochondria to regulate mitochondrial gene mt-COX1 and influence obesity-induced cardiac dysfunction through the mitochondrial pathway. Because liver plays a pivotal role during obesity, we hypothesized that miR-181c might contribute to the pathophysiological complications associated with obesity. Therefore, we used miR-181c/d-/- mice to study the role of miR-181c in hepatocyte lipogenesis during diet-induced obesity. The mice were fed a high-fat (HF) diet for 26 weeks, during which indirect calorimetric measurements were made. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to examine the expression of genes involved in lipid synthesis. We found that miR-181c/d-/- mice were not protected against all metabolic consequences of HF exposure. After 26 weeks, the miR-181c/d-/- mice had a significantly higher body fat percentage than did wild-type (WT) mice. Glucose tolerance tests showed hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia, indicative of insulin insensitivity in the miR-181c/d-/- mice. miR-181c/d-/- mice fed the HF diet had higher serum and liver triglyceride levels than did WT mice fed the same diet. qPCR data showed that several genes regulated by isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) were more upregulated in miR-181c/d-/- liver than in WT liver. Furthermore, miR-181c delivered in vivo via adeno-associated virus attenuated the lipogenesis by downregulating these same lipid synthesis genes in the liver. In hepatocytes, miR-181c regulates lipid biosynthesis by targeting IDH1. Taken together, the data indicate that overexpression of miR-181c can be beneficial for various lipid metabolism disorders.",PloS one,2021,primary,doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0256973,34879063,PMC8654194,https://doi.org/doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0256973

The emergence of microRNA signaling as a key regulator of vascular structure and function has stimulated interest in assessing its role in the pathophysiology of LAS. Identification of several microRNAs that display age-associated changes in expression in aorta has focused attention on defining their molecular targets and deciphering their role in age-associated arterial stiffening. Inactivation of the microRNA-degrading enzyme, translin/trax, which reverses the age-dependent decline in miR-181b, confers protection from aging-associated arterial stiffening, suggesting that inhibitors targeting this enzyme may have translational potential. As LAS poses a major public health challenge, we anticipate that future studies based on these advances will yield innovative strategies to combat aging-associated arterial stiffening.",Frontiers in physiology,2021,primary,doi:10.3389/fphys.2021.747789,34646165,PMC8504676,https://doi.org/doi:10.3389/fphys.2021.747789

Although three-dimensional cell culture better recapitulates the heterogeneity observed in tumor growth and extracellular vesicle (EV) biogenesis, the physiological relevance is often contrasted with the control offered by two-dimensional cell culture. Therefore, to challenge this misconception we developed a novel microfluidic system harboring highly tunable three-dimensional EV microbioreactors (EVμBRs) to model micrometastatic EV release in breast cancer while capitalizing on the convenient, low-volume, and sterile interface provided by microfluidics. The diameter and cellular occupancy of the EVμBRs could be precisely tailored to various configurations, supporting the formation of breast cancer tumor spheroids. To immobilize the EVμBRs within a microchannel and facilitate EV extraction, oxygen inhibition in free-radical polymerization was repurposed to rapidly generate two-layer hydrodynamic traps in situ using a digital-micromirror device (DMD)-based ultraviolet (UV) projection system. Breast cancer tumor spheroid-derived EVs were harvested with as little as 20 μL from the microfluidic system and quantified by single-EV immunofluorescence for CD63 and CD81. Despite the low-volume extraction, differences in biomarker expression and coexpression of the tetraspanins on single EVs were observed. Furthermore, the EVμBRs were capable of recapitulating heterogeneity at a cellular and vesicular degree, indicating the utility and robustness of the microfluidic system to investigate physiologically relevant EVs in breast cancer and other disease models.",Lab on a chip,2022,primary,doi:10.1039/d1lc01053k,35579189,PMC9383696,https://doi.org/doi:10.1039/d1lc01053k

In this study, we built a real-time smartwatch-based alerting system that detects aberrant physiological and activity signals (heart rates and steps) associated with the onset of early infection and implemented this system in a prospective study. In a cohort of 3,318 participants, of whom 84 were infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), this system generated alerts for pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in 67 (80%) of the infected individuals. Pre-symptomatic signals were observed at a median of 3 days before symptom onset. Examination of detailed survey responses provided by the participants revealed that other respiratory infections as well as events not associated with infection, such as stress, alcohol consumption and travel, could also trigger alerts, albeit at a much lower mean frequency (1.15 alert days per person compared to 3.42 alert days per person for coronavirus disease 2019 cases). Thus, analysis of smartwatch signals by an online detection algorithm provides advance warning of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a high percentage of cases. This study shows that a real-time alerting system can be used for early detection of infection and other stressors and employed on an open-source platform that is scalable to millions of users.",Nature medicine,2022,primary,doi:10.1038/s41591-021-01593-2,34845389,PMC8799466,https://doi.org/doi:10.1038/s41591-021-01593-2

Thus this system has potential both for advanced warning of COVID-19 as well as a general system for measuring health via detection of physiological shifts from personal baselines.

A common pitfall when utilizing AuNPs is their tendency to aggregate, especially when their surface is functionalized with ligands of low molecular weight (no steric repulsion) or ligands of neutral charge (no electrostatic repulsion). For biomedical applications, AuNPs that are colloidally stable are desirable because they have a high surface area and thus reactivity, resist sedimentation, and exhibit uniform optical properties. Here, we engineer the surface of AuNPs so that they remain stable when decorated with coiled-coil (CC) peptides while preserving the native polypeptide properties. We achieve this by using a neutral, mixed ligand layer composed of lipoic acid poly(ethylene glycol) and lipoic acid poly(ethylene glycol) maleimide to attach the CCs. Tuning the surface fraction of each component within the mixed ligand layer also allowed us to control the degree of AuNP labeling with CCs. We demonstrate the dynamic surface properties of these CC-AuNPs by performing a place-exchange reaction and their utility by designing an energy-transfer-based caspase-3 sensor. Overall, this study optimizes the surface chemistry of AuNPs to quantitatively present functional biomolecules while maintaining colloid stability.",The journal of physical chemistry.

Here, we propose a peptide-driven nanoscale disassembly approach, where AuNP aggregates induced by electrostatic attractions are dissociated in response to proteolytic cleavage. Initially, citrate-coated AuNPs were assembled via a short cationic peptide (RRK) and characterized by experiments and simulations. The dissociation peptides were then used to reversibly dissociate the AuNP aggregates as a function of target protease detection, i.e., main protease (Mpro), a biomarker for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The dissociation propensity depends on peptide length, hydrophilicity, charge, and ligand architecture. Finally, our dissociation strategy provides a rapid and distinct optical signal through Mpro cleavage with a detection limit of 12.3 nM in saliva. Our dissociation peptide effectively dissociates plasmonic assemblies in diverse matrices including 100% human saliva, urine, plasma, and seawater, as well as other types of plasmonic nanoparticles such as silver. Our peptide-enabled dissociation platform provides a simple, matrix-insensitive, and versatile method for protease sensing.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2023,primary,doi:10.1021/acsami.3c09627,37651748,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1021/acsami.3c09627

Compartmentalized enzyme reactions in a synthetic coacervate have been investigated, yet there remains a gap in understanding the enzyme interactions with coacervate as a substrate hub. Here, we study how the molecularly crowded nature of the coacervate affects the interactions of the embedded substrate with a protease. We design oligopeptide-based coacervates that comprise an anionic Asp-peptide (D10) and a cationic Arg-peptide (R5R5) with a proteolytic cleavage site. The coacervates dissolve in the presence of the main protease (Mpro) implicated in the coronavirus lifecycle. We capitalize on the condensed structure, introduce a self-quenching mechanism, and model the enzyme kinetics by using Cy5.5-labeled peptides. The determined specificity constant (kcat/KM) is 5817 M-1 s-1 and is similar to that of the free substrate. We further show that the enzyme kinetics depend on the type and quantity of dye incorporated into the coacervates.

Due to a lack of effective antiviral therapies, there is a need to diagnose and surveil norovirus infections to implement quarantine protocols and prevent large outbreaks. Currently, the gold standard of diagnosis uses reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), but PCR can have limited availability. Here, we propose a combination of a tunable peptide substrate and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to colorimetrically detect the Southampton norovirus 3C-like protease (SV3CP), a key protease in viral replication. Careful design of the substrate employs a zwitterionic peptide with opposite charged moieties on the C- and N- termini to induce a rapid color change visible to the naked eye; thus, this color change is indicative of SV3CP activity. This work expands on existing zwitterionic peptide strategies for protease detection by systematically evaluating the effects of lysine and arginine on nanoparticle charge screening. We also determine a limit of detection for SV3CP of 28.0 nM with comparable results in external breath condensate, urine, and fecal matter for 100 nM of SV3CP. The key advantage of this system is its simplicity and accessibility, thus making it an attractive tool for qualitative point-of-care diagnostics.",The Analyst,2023,primary,doi:10.1039/d3an00873h,37578304,,https://doi.org/doi:10.1039/d3an00873h

These aspects have been exploited to design nanoparticle aggregation-based colorimetric sensors. Here, we coated 13-nm gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with a large library of ligands (e.g., from labile monodentate monomers to multicoordinating macromolecules) and evaluated their aggregation propensity in the presence of three peptides containing charged, thiolate, or aromatic amino acids. Our results show that AuNPs coated with the polyphenols and sulfonated phosphine ligands were good choices for electrostatic-based aggregation. AuNPs capped with citrate and labile-binding polymers worked well for dithiol-bridging and π-π stacking-induced aggregation. In the example of electrostatic-based assays, we stress that good sensing performance requires aggregating peptides of low charge valence paired with charged NPs with weak stability and vice versa. We then present a modular peptide containing versatile aggregating residues to agglomerate a variety of ligated AuNPs for colorimetric detection of the coronavirus main protease. Enzymatic cleavage liberates the peptide segment, which in turn triggers NP agglomeration and thus rapid color changes in <10 min.

The Schulze-Hardy rule states that nanoparticles have a higher tendency to coagulate in the presence of counterions with high charge valence. However, it is unclear how the Schulze-Hardy rule works when the simple electrolytes are replaced with more sophisticated charge carriers. Here, we designed cationic peptides of varying valencies and demonstrate that their charge screening behaviors on anionic gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) follow the six-power relationship in the Schulze-Hardy rule. This finding further inspires a simple yet effective strategy for measuring SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) via naked eyes.

TMPRSS2 inhibition can reduce cancer invasion and metastasis and partially prevent the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells. Thus, there is an urgent need for both TMPRSS2-selective imaging and precise screening of TMPRSS2 inhibitors. Here, we report a TMPRSS2-responsive surface-potential-tunable peptide-conjugated probe (EGTP) with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) features for TMPRSS2 selective imaging and accurate inhibitor screening. The amphiphilic EGTP was constructed with tunable surface potential and responsive efficiency with TMPRSS2 and its inhibitor. The rational construction of AIE luminogens (AIEgens) with modular peptides indicated that the cleavage of EGTP led to a gradual aggregation with bright fluorescence in high TMPRSS2-expressing cells.

The SLPs programmed in DDD-(ZZ)x -FFPC self-assemble into higher-order structures in response to a protease and subsequently modulate the colloidal dispersity of gold leading to a colorimetric readout. Results show the strong aggregation propensity of the FFPC tail without polar DDD head. The SLPs were specific to the target protease, i.e., Mpro , a biomarker for SARS-CoV-2.

The LSPR of nanoparticles can shift in response to changes in the local dielectric environment and produce a color change. This color change can be observed by the naked eye due to the exceptionally large extinction coefficients (108-1011 M-1 cm-1) of plasmonic nanoparticles. Herein, we investigate the optical shifts (i.e., color change) of three unique gold-silver core-shell nanoparticle structures in response to changes in their dielectric environment upon nanoparticle aggregation. Aggregation is induced by a cysteine-containing peptide that has a sulfhydryl near its N and C termini, which crosslinks nanoparticles. Furthermore, we demonstrate that adding proline spacers between the cysteines impacts the degree of aggregation and, ultimately, the color response. Using this information, we construct a colorimetric enzyme assay, where the signal produced from nanoparticle aggregation is modulated by proteolysis. The degree of aggregation and the resulting optical shift can be correlated with enzyme concentration with high linearity (R2 = 0.998).

Here, we customized an all-peptide-based ligand that carries an anchoring group, polyproline spacer, biomolecular recognition, and zwitterionic domains for functionalizing gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as a colorimetric enzyme sensor. Our results underscore the importance of the polyproline module, which enables the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) to recognize the peptidic ligand on nanosurfaces for subsequent plasmonic coupling via Coulombic interactions. AuNP aggregation is favored by the lowered surface potential due to enzymatic unveiling of the zwitterionic module. Therefore, this system provides a naked-eye measure for Mpro.

The AuNPs were first aggregated by attractive forces between the citrate-capped surface and the arginine side chains. We found that the HS-PEG thiol group has a higher affinity for the AuNP surface, thus leading to redispersion and colloidal stability. In turn, there was a robust and obvious color change due to on/off plasmonic coupling. The assemblies' dissociation was directly related to the HS-PEG structural properties such as their size or charge. As an example, HS-PEGs with a molecular weight below 1 kDa could dissociate 100% of the assemblies and restore the exact optical properties of the initial AuNP suspension (prior to the assembly). Surprisingly, the dissociation capacity of HS-PEGs was not affected by the composition of the operating medium and could be performed in complex matrices such as plasma, saliva, bile, urine, cell lysates, or even seawater. The high affinity of thiols for the gold surface encompasses by far the one of endogenous molecules and is thus favored. Moreover, starting with AuNPs already aggregated ensured the absence of a background signal as the dissociation of the assemblies was far from spontaneous. Remarkably, it was possible to dry the AuNP assemblies and solubilize them back with HS-PEGs, improving the colorimetric signal generation. We used this system for protease sensing in biological fluids. Trypsin was chosen as the model enzyme, and highly positively charged peptides were conjugated to HS-PEG molecules as cleavage substrates. The increase of positive charge of the HS-PEG-peptide conjugate quenched the dissociation capacity of the HS-PEG molecules, which could only be restored by the proteolytic cleavage.

This fluorescent probe was prepared by connecting a Mpro-cleavable peptide (N-acetyl-Abu-Tle-Leu-Gln) with a fluorophore (i.e., resorufin) via a self-immolative aromatic linker. Fluorescent titration results show that MP590 can detect Mpro with a limit of detection (LoD) of 35 nM and is selective over interferents such as hemoglobin, bovine serum albumin (BSA), thrombin, amylase, SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PLpro), and trypsin. The cell imaging data indicate that this probe can report Mpro in HEK 293T cells transfected with a Mpro expression plasmid as well as in TMPRSS2-VeroE6 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2.

The dynamic process of this assembly was systematically investigated, and the extinction of the nanostructures can be modulated from 400 to 600 nm by varying the peptide sequences and molar ratio. According to this rationale, two strategies of SARS-CoV-2 detection were investigated. The activity of the main protease (Mpro) involved in SARS-CoV-2 was validated with a peptide substrate that can bridge the AgNPs after the proteolytic cleavage.

doi:10.1021/acsami.1c11620,Modulation of Gold Nanorod Growth via the Proteolysis of Dithiol Peptides for Enzymatic Biomarker Detection.,"Gold nanorods possess optical properties that are tunable and highly sensitive to variations in their aspect ratio (length/width). Therefore, the development of a sensing platform where the gold nanorod morphology (i.e., aspect ratio) is modulated in response to an analyte holds promise in achieving ultralow detection limits. Here, we use a dithiol peptide as an enzyme substrate during nanorod growth. The sensing mechanism is enabled by the substrate design, where the dithiol peptide contains an enzyme cleavage site in-between cysteine amino acids. When cleaved, the peptide dramatically impacts gold nanorod growth and the resulting optical properties. We demonstrate that the optical response can be correlated with enzyme concentration and achieve a 45 pM limit of detection. Furthermore, we extend this sensing platform to colorimetrically detect tumor-associated inhibitors in a biologically relevant medium. Overall, these results present a subnanomolar method to detect proteases that are critical biomarkers found in cancers, infectious diseases, and inflammatory disorders.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,2021,primary,doi:10.1021/acsami.1c11620,34520186,PMC8549377,https://doi.org/doi:10.1021/acsami.1c11620
doi:10.1021/acs.analchem.1c02399,Mapping Aerosolized Saliva on Face Coverings for Biosensing Applications.,"Facemasks in congregate settings prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and help control the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic because face coverings can arrest transmission of respiratory droplets. While many groups have studied face coverings as personal protective equipment, these respiratory droplets can also serve as a diagnostic fluid to report on health state; surprisingly, studies of face coverings from this perspective are quite limited. Here, we determined the concentration and distribution of aerosolized saliva (via α-amylase levels) captured on various face coverings. Our results showed that α-amylase accumulated on face coverings in a time-dependent way albeit at different levels, e.g., neck gaiters and surgical masks captured about 3-fold more α-amylase than cloth masks and N95 respirators. In addition, the saliva aerosols were primarily detected on the inner layer of multilayered face coverings. We also found that the distribution of salivary droplets on the mask correlated with the morphologies of face coverings as well as their coherence to the face curvature. These findings motivated us to extend this work and build multifunctional sensing strips capable of detecting biomarkers in situ to create ""smart"" masks. The work highlights that face coverings are promising platforms for biofluid collection and colorimetric biosensing, which bode well for developing surveillance tools for airborne diseases.",Analytical chemistry,2021,primary,doi:10.1021/acs.analchem.1c02399,34309356,PMC8543450,https://doi.org/doi:10.1021/acs.analchem.1c02399
doi:10.1021/acssensors.1c00518,Activatable Carbocyanine Dimers for Photoacoustic and Fluorescent Detection of Protease Activity.,"Activatable contrast agents are of ongoing research interest because they offer low background and high specificity to the imaging target. Engineered sensitivity to protease activity is particularly desirable because proteases are critical biomarkers in cancer, infectious disease, inflammatory disorders, and so forth. Herein, we developed and characterized a set of peptide-linked cyanine conjugates for dual-modal detection of protease activity via photoacoustic (PA) and fluorescence imaging. The peptide-dye conjugates were designed to undergo contact quenching via intramolecular dimerization and contained n dyes (n = 2, 3, or 4) with n - 1 cleavable peptide substrates. The absorption peaks of the conjugates were blue-shifted 50 nm relative to the free dye and had quenched fluorescence. This effect was sensitive to solvent polarity and could be reversed by solvent switching from water to dimethyl sulfoxide. Employing trypsin as a model protease, we observed a 2.5-fold recovery of the peak absorbance, 330-4600-fold fluorescent enhancement, and picomolar detection limits following proteolysis. The dimer probe was further characterized for PA activation. Proteolysis released single dye-peptide fragments that produced a 5-fold PA enhancement through the increased absorption at 680 nm with nanomolar sensitivity to trypsin. The peptide substrate could also be tuned for protease selectivity; as a proof-of-concept, we detected the main protease (Mpro) associated with the viral replication in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Last, the activated probe was imaged subcutaneously in mice and signal was linearly correlated to the cleaved probe. Overall, these results demonstrate a tunable scaffold for the PA molecular imaging of protease activity with potential value in areas such as disease monitoring, tumor imaging, intraoperative imaging, in vitro diagnostics, and point-of-care sensing.",ACS sensors,2021,primary,doi:10.1021/acssensors.1c00518,34038103,PMC8375416,https://doi.org/doi:10.1021/acssensors.1c00518

Existing approaches to estimating the time origins are commonly built on extrapolating a parametric longitudinal model, which rely on rigid assumptions that can lead to biased inferences. In this paper, we introduce a flexible semiparametric curve registration model. It assumes the longitudinal trajectories follow a flexible common shape function with person-specific disease progression pattern characterized by a random curve registration function, which is further used to model the unknown time origin as a random start time. This random time is used as a link to jointly model the longitudinal and survival data where the unknown time origins are integrated out in the joint likelihood function, which facilitates unbiased and consistent estimation. Since the disease progression pattern naturally predicts time-to-event, we further propose a new functional survival model using the registration function as a predictor of the time-to-event. The asymptotic consistency and semiparametric efficiency of the proposed models are proved. Simulation studies and two real data applications demonstrate the effectiveness of this new approach.",Journal of the American Statistical Association,2023,primary,doi:10.1080/01621459.2021.2023552,37771511,PMC10530746,https://doi.org/doi:10.1080/01621459.2021.2023552

Although studies have found that central venous catheter (CVC) is often associated with poor outcomes and switching to arteriovenous fistula (AVF) and arteriovenous grafts (AVG) is beneficial, it has not been fully elucidated how the effect of switching of access on outcomes changes over time and whether the effect depends on switching time. In this paper we propose to relate the observed survival time for patients without access change and the counterfactual time for patients with access change using an AFT model with time-varying effects. The flexibility of AFT model allows us to account for baseline effect and the prognostic effect from covariates at access change while estimating the effect of access change. The effect of access change overtime is modeled nonparametrically using a cubic spline function. Simulation studies show excellent performance. Our methods are applied to investigate the effect of vascular access change over time in dialysis patients. It is concluded that the benefit of switching from CVC to AVG depends on the time of switching, the sooner the better.",Communications in statistics: theory and methods,2023,primary,doi:10.1080/03610926.2021.2004423,37588769,PMC10427130,https://doi.org/doi:10.1080/03610926.2021.2004423

While various nonparametric and semiparametric models have been developed, there is an urgent need for model selection and diagnostic methods. In this article, we develop a unified framework for estimation and model selection in nonparametric function-on-function regression. We propose a general nonparametric functional regression model with the model space constructed through smoothing spline analysis of variance (SS ANOVA). The proposed model reduces to some of the existing models when selected components in the SS ANOVA decomposition are eliminated. We propose new estimation procedures under either L 1 or L 2 penalty and show that the combination of the SS ANOVA decomposition and L 1 penalty provides powerful tools for model selection and diagnostics. We establish consistency and convergence rates for estimates of the regression function and each component in its decomposition under both the L 1 and L 2 penalties. Simulation studies and real examples show that the proposed methods perform well.

However, it is not straightforward to interpret the Brier score for a prediction model since its value depends on the outcome prevalence. We decompose the Brier score into two components, the mean squares between the estimated and true underlying binary probabilities, and the variance of the binary outcome that is not reflective of the model performance. We then propose to modify the Brier score by removing the variance of the binary outcome, estimated via a general sliding window approach. We show that the new proposed measure is more sensitive for comparing different models through simulation. A standardized performance improvement measure is also proposed based on the new criterion to quantify the improvement of prediction performance. We apply the new measures to the data from the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium and compare the performance of predicting breast cancer risk using the models with and without its most important predictor.",Statistical methods in medical research,2022,primary,doi:10.1177/09622802221122391,36031854,PMC9691523,https://doi.org/doi:10.1177/09622802221122391

Existing methods are either done in an ad hoc fashion, such as model recalibration or focus on studying the relationship between predictors and outcome and less so for the purpose of prediction. In this article, we propose a dynamic logistic state space model to continuously update the parameters whenever new information becomes available. The proposed model allows for both time-varying and time-invariant coefficients. The varying coefficients are modeled using smoothing splines to account for their smooth trends over time. The smoothing parameters are objectively chosen by maximum likelihood. The model is updated using batch data accumulated at prespecified time intervals, which allows for better approximation of the underlying binomial density function.

An objective method with high specificity and high sensitivity to identify current or imminent MIS-C in children infected with SARS-CoV-2 is highly desirable. The aim was to learn about an interpretable novel cytokine/chemokine assay panel providing such an objective classification. This retrospective study was conducted on four groups of pediatric patients seen at multiple sites of Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX who consented to provide blood samples to our COVID-19 Biorepository. Standard laboratory markers of inflammation and a novel cytokine/chemokine array were measured in blood samples of all patients. Group 1 consisted of 72 COVID-19, 70 MIS-C and 63 uninfected control patients seen between May 2020 and January 2021 and predominantly infected with pre-alpha variants. Group 2 consisted of 29 COVID-19 and 43 MIS-C patients seen between January and May 2021 infected predominantly with the alpha variant. Group 3 consisted of 30 COVID-19 and 32 MIS-C patients seen between August and October 2021 infected with alpha and/or delta variants. Group 4 consisted of 20 COVID-19 and 46 MIS-C patients seen between October 2021 andJanuary 2022 infected with delta and/or omicron variants. Group 1 was used to train an L1-regularized logistic regression model which was tested using five-fold cross validation, and then separately validated against the remaining naïve groups. The area under receiver operating curve (AUROC) and F1-score were used to quantify the performance of the cytokine/chemokine assay-based classifier. Standard laboratory markers predict MIS-C with a five-fold cross-validated AUROC of 0.86 ± 0.05 and an F1 score of 0.78 ± 0.07, while the cytokine/chemokine panel predicted MIS-C with a five-fold cross-validated AUROC of 0.95 ± 0.02 and an F1 score of 0.91 ± 0.04, with only sixteen of the forty-five cytokines/chemokines sufficient to achieve this performance. Tested on Group 2 the cytokine/chemokine panel yielded AUROC = 0.98 and F1 = 0.93, on Group 3 it yielded AUROC = 0.89 and F1 = 0.89, and on Group 4 AUROC = 0.99 and F1 = 0.97.

We determined whether dysfunction is global or regional, and whether it is associated with the cytokine milieu, microangiopathy, or severity of shock. Methods and Results We analyzed echocardiographic parameters of myocardial deformation and compared global and segmental left ventricular strain between 43 cases with MIS-C ≤18 years old and 40 controls. Primary outcomes included left ventricular global longitudinal strain, right ventricular free wall strain), and left atrial strain. We evaluated relationships between strain and profiles of 10 proinflammatory cytokines, microangiopathic features (soluble C5b9), and vasoactive-inotropic requirements. Compared with controls, cases with MIS-C had significant impairments in all parameters of systolic and diastolic function. 65% of cases with MIS-C had abnormal left ventricular function (|global longitudinal strain|<17%), although elevations of cytokines were modest. All left ventricular segments were involved, without apical or basal dominance to suggest acute stress cardiomyopathy. Worse global longitudinal strain correlated with higher ratios of interleukin-6 (ρ -0.43) and interleukin-8 (ρ -0.43) to total hypercytokinemia, but not absolute levels of interleukin-6 or interleukin-8, or total hypercytokinemia. Similarly, worse right ventricular free wall strain correlated with higher relative interleukin-8 expression (ρ -0.59). There were no significant associations between function and microangiopathy or vasoactive-inotropic requirements. Conclusions Myocardial function is globally decreased in MIS-C and not explained by acute stress cardiomyopathy. Cardiac dysfunction may be driven by the relative skew of the immune response toward interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 pathways, more so than degree of hyperinflammation, refining the current paradigm of myocardial involvement in MIS-C.",Journal of the American Heart Association,2021,primary,doi:10.1161/JAHA.121.021428,34365798,PMC8475050,https://doi.org/doi:10.1161/JAHA.121.021428

A subset of children, however, present with Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) that can lead to vascular complications and shock, but rarely death. The immune features of MIS-C compared to pediatric COVID-19 or adult disease remain poorly understood. We analyzed peripheral blood immune responses in hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 infected pediatric patients (pediatric COVID-19) and patients with MIS-C. MIS-C patients had patterns of T cell-biased lymphopenia and T cell activation similar to severely ill adults, and all patients with MIS-C had SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific antibodies at admission. A distinct feature of MIS-C patients was robust activation of vascular patrolling CX3CR1+ CD8+ T cells that correlated with the use of vasoactive medication. Finally, whereas pediatric COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) had sustained immune activation, MIS-C patients displayed clinical improvement over time, concomitant with decreasing immune activation.

Institutions rapidly assembled task forces to develop treatment algorithms. At the national/international levels, collaboratives and associations assembled consensus writing groups to draft guidelines. These guidelines and algorithms were initially on the basis of expert opinion and small case series. Some groups used the Delphi approach, and the resultant guidelines often mimicked those for other conditions that resembled MIS-C, like Kawasaki disease (KD). For instance, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), a known effective treatment for KD, was recommended for MIS-C. Early in the pandemic many favoured IVIG over steroids as first-line therapy. As evidence evolved so did some guidelines, which now endorse the dual use of IVIG with steroids as first-line therapy. In contrast, withholding immunotherapy became an option for some MIS-C patients with mild symptoms. Herein, we review guidelines and discuss the evidence informing early recommendations, how this has evolved, the role and limitations of expert opinion and observational data, and the importance of leveraging existing research infrastructures, such as the intensive care unit collaborative (Overcoming COVID-19 surveillance registry), and the International Kawasaki Disease Registry.

Serology, which detects the host antibody response to the infection, is the most appropriate tool for this task, since virus-derived markers are most reliably detected during the acute phase of infection.

Moreover, our protocol accommodates use of various blood- and non-blood-derived biospecimens, such as breast milk, as well as dried blood obtained with microsampling cartridges that are appropriate for remote collection.

CD4+ and CD8+ SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were detected in 5 subjects, CD4+ T helper (Th) responses alone were detected in 12 subjects, and CD8+ cytotoxic T cell (CTL) responses alone were documented in 1 subject. Notably, a sizeable subpopulation of CD4- CD8- double-negative (DN) T cells out of total CD3+ T cells was observed in MIS-C (median: 14.5%; IQR 8.65-25.3) and recognized SARS-CoV-2 peptides. T cells bearing the Vβ21.3 T cell receptor (TcRs), previously reported as pathogenic in the context of MIS-C, were detected in high frequencies, namely, in 2.8% and 3.9% of the CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, respectively. However, Vβ21.3 CD8+ T cells that responded to SARS-CoV-2 peptides were detected in only a single subject, suggesting recognition of nonviral antigens in the majority of subjects. Subjects studied 6-14 months after MIS-C showed T cell epitope spreading, meaning the activation of T cells that recognize more SARS-CoV-2 peptides following the initial expansion of T cells that see immunodominant epitopes. For example, subjects that did not recognize nonspike proteins in the subacute phase of MIS-C showed good Th response to nonspike peptides, and/or CD8+ T cell responses not appreciable before arose over time and could be detected in the 6-14 months' follow-up. The magnitude of the Th and CTL responses also increased over time.

Here we show that 30% of adults with COVID-19 had autoantibodies against the lung antigen KCNRG, and 34% had antibodies to the SLE-associated Smith-D3 protein. Children with COVID-19 rarely had autoantibodies; one of 59 children had GAD65 autoantibodies associated with acute onset of insulin-dependent diabetes. While autoantibodies associated with SLE/Sjögren's syndrome (Ro52, Ro60, and La) and/or autoimmune gastritis (gastric ATPase) were detected in 74% (40/54) of MIS-C patients, further analysis of these patients and of children with Kawasaki disease (KD), showed that the administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was largely responsible for detection of these autoantibodies in both groups of patients. Monitoring in vivo decay of the autoantibodies in MIS-C children showed that the IVIG-derived Ro52, Ro60, and La autoantibodies declined to undetectable levels by 45-60 days, but gastric ATPase autoantibodies declined more slowly requiring >100 days until undetectable. Further testing of IgG and/or IgA antibodies against a subset of potential targets identified by published autoantigen array studies of MIS-C failed to detect autoantibodies against most (16/18) of these proteins in patients with MIS-C who had not received IVIG. However, Troponin C2 and KLHL12 autoantibodies were detected in 2 of 20 and 1 of 20 patients with MIS-C, respectively. Overall, these results suggest that IVIG therapy may be a confounding factor in autoantibody measurements in MIS-C and that antibodies against antigens associated with autoimmune diseases or other human proteins are uncommon in MIS-C.",Frontiers in immunology,2022,primary,doi:10.3389/fimmu.2022.841126,35360001,PMC8962198,https://doi.org/doi:10.3389/fimmu.2022.841126

Despite several successful implementations of PhIP-Seq for autoantigen discovery, including our previous work (Vazquez et al. 2020), current protocols are inherently difficult to scale to accommodate large cohorts of cases and importantly, healthy controls. Here, we develop and validate a high throughput extension of PhIP-seq in various etiologies of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including APS1, IPEX, RAG1/2 deficiency, Kawasaki Disease (KD), Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), and finally, mild and severe forms of COVID19. We demonstrate that these scaled datasets enable machine-learning approaches that result in robust prediction of disease status, as well as the ability to detect both known and novel autoantigens, such as PDYN in APS1 patients, and intestinally expressed proteins BEST4 and BTNL8 in IPEX patients. Remarkably, BEST4 antibodies were also found in 2 patients with RAG1/2 deficiency, one of whom had very early onset IBD. Scaled PhIP-Seq examination of both MIS-C and KD demonstrated rare, overlapping antigens, including CGNL1, as well as several strongly enriched putative pneumonia-associated antigens in severe COVID19, including the endosomal protein EEA1.

Here, we studied SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in MIS-C, Kawasaki disease (KD), and SARS-CoV-2 convalescent controls using peptide pools derived from SARS-CoV-2 spike or nonspike proteins, and common cold coronaviruses (CCC). Coordinated CD4+ and CD8+ SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were detected in five MIS-C subjects with cross-reactivity to CCC. CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses alone were documented in three and one subjects, respectively. T-cell specificities in MIS-C did not correlate with disease severity and were similar to SARS-CoV-2 convalescent controls. T-cell memory and cross-reactivity to CCC in MIS-C and SARS-CoV-2 convalescent controls were also similar. The chemokine receptor CCR6, but not CCR9, was highly expressed on SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ but not on CD8+ T cells. Only two of 10 KD subjects showed a T-cell response to CCC. Enumeration of myeloid APCs revealed low cell precursors in MIS-C subjects compared to KD. In summary, children with MIS-C mount a normal T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 with no apparent relationship to antecedent CCC exposure.

doi:10.1172/JCI147076,Immune response to intravenous immunoglobulin in patients with Kawasaki disease and MIS-C.,"BACKGROUNDMultisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a rare but potentially severe illness that follows exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Kawasaki disease (KD) shares several clinical features with MIS-C, which prompted the use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), a mainstay therapy for KD. Both diseases share a robust activation of the innate immune system, including the IL-1 signaling pathway, and IL-1 blockade has been used for the treatment of both MIS-C and KD. The mechanism of action of IVIG in these 2 diseases and the cellular source of IL-1β have not been defined.METHODSThe effects of IVIG on peripheral blood leukocyte populations from patients with MIS-C and KD were examined using flow cytometry and mass cytometry (CyTOF) and live-cell imaging.RESULTSCirculating neutrophils were highly activated in patients with KD and MIS-C and were a major source of IL-1β. Following IVIG treatment, activated IL-1β+ neutrophils were reduced in the circulation. In vitro, IVIG was a potent activator of neutrophil cell death via PI3K and NADPH oxidase, but independently of caspase activation.CONCLUSIONSActivated neutrophils expressing IL-1β can be targeted by IVIG, supporting its use in both KD and MIS-C to ameliorate inflammation.FUNDINGPatient Centered Outcomes Research Institute; NIH; American Asthma Foundation; American Heart Association; Novo Nordisk Foundation; NIGMS; American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Foundation.",The Journal of clinical investigation,2021,primary,doi:10.1172/JCI147076,34464357,PMC8516453,https://doi.org/doi:10.1172/JCI147076

doi:10.3389/fbioe.2023.1066391,Development of a biomarker signature using grating-coupled fluorescence plasmonic microarray for diagnosis of MIS-C.,"Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a rare but serious condition that can develop 4-6 weeks after a school age child becomes infected by SARS-CoV-2. To date, in the United States more than 8,862 cases of MIS-C have been identified and 72 deaths have occurred. This syndrome typically affects children between the ages of 5-13; 57% are Hispanic/Latino/Black/non-Hispanic, 61% of patients are males and 100% have either tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 or had direct contact with someone with COVID-19. Unfortunately, diagnosis of MIS-C is difficult, and delayed diagnosis can lead to cardiogenic shock, intensive care admission, and prolonged hospitalization. There is no validated biomarker for the rapid diagnosis of MIS-C. In this study, we used Grating-coupled Fluorescence Plasmonic (GCFP) microarray technology to develop biomarker signatures in pediatric salvia and serum samples from patients with MIS-C in the United States and Colombia. GCFP measures antibody-antigen interactions at individual regions of interest (ROIs) on a gold-coated diffraction grating sensor chip in a sandwich immunoassay to generate a fluorescent signal based on analyte presence within a sample. Using a microarray printer, we designed a first-generation biosensor chip with the capability of capturing 33 different analytes from 80  μ L  of sample (saliva or serum). Here, we show potential biomarker signatures in both saliva and serum samples in six patient cohorts. In saliva samples, we noted occasional analyte outliers on the chip within individual samples and were able to compare those samples to 16S RNA microbiome data. These comparisons indicate differences in relative abundance of oral pathogens within those patients. Microsphere Immunoassay (MIA) of immunoglobulin isotypes was also performed on serum samples and revealed MIS-C patients had several COVID antigen-specific immunoglobulins that were significantly higher than other cohorts, thus identifying potential new targets for the second-generation biosensor chip. MIA also identified additional biomarkers for our second-generation chip, verified biomarker signatures generated on the first-generation chip, and aided in second-generation chip optimization. Interestingly, MIS-C samples from the United States had a more diverse and robust signature than the Colombian samples, which was also illustrated in the MIA cytokine data. These observations identify new MIS-C biomarkers and biomarker signatures for each of the cohorts. Ultimately, these tools may represent a potential diagnostic tool for use in the rapid identification of MIS-C.",Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology,2023,primary,doi:10.3389/fbioe.2023.1066391,37064248,PMC10102909,https://doi.org/doi:10.3389/fbioe.2023.1066391

Such an approach requires understanding how differences in experimental design affect miRNA expression. Variations in technical methodologies, coupled with inter-individual variability may reduce study reproducibility and generalizability. Another barrier facing salivary miRNA biomarker research is a lack of recognized ""control miRNAs"". In one of the largest studies of human salivary miRNA to date (922 healthy individuals), we utilized 1225 saliva samples to quantify variability in miRNA expression resulting from aligner selection (Bowtie1 vs. Bowtie2), saliva collection method (expectorated vs. swabbed), RNA stabilizer (presence vs. absence), and individual biological factors (sex, age, body mass index, exercise, caloric intake). Differential expression analyses revealed that absence of RNA stabilizer introduced the greatest variability, followed by differences in methods of collection and aligner. Biological factors generally affected a smaller number of miRNAs. We also reported coefficients of variations for 643 miRNAs consistently present in saliva, highlighting several salivary miRNAs to serve as reference genes. Thus, the results of this analysis can be used by researchers to optimize parameters of salivary miRNA measurement, exclude miRNAs confounded by numerous biologic factors, and identify appropriate miRNA controls.",Genes,2022,primary,doi:10.3390/genes13101874,36292760,PMC9602126,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/genes13101874

Ordinal regression is a method to predict ordinal labels that finds a wide range of applications in data-rich domains, such as natural, health and social sciences. Most existing ordinal regression approaches work well for independent and identically distributed (IID) instances via formulating a single ordinal regression task. However, for heterogeneous non-IID instances with well-defined local geometric structures, e.g., subpopulation groups, multi-task learning (MTL) provides a promising framework to encode task (subgroup) relatedness, bridge data from all tasks, and simultaneously learn multiple related tasks in efforts to improve generalization performance. Even though MTL methods have been extensively studied, there is barely existing work investigating MTL for heterogeneous data with ordinal labels. We tackle this important problem via sparse and deep multi-task approaches. Specifically, we develop a regularized multi-task ordinal regression (MTOR) model for smaller datasets and a deep neural networks based MTOR model for large-scale datasets. We evaluate the performance using three real-world healthcare datasets with applications to multi-stage disease progression diagnosis. Our experiments indicate that the proposed MTOR models markedly improve the prediction performance comparing with single-task ordinal regression models.",Data mining and knowledge discovery,2021,primary,doi:10.1007/s10618-021-00746-8,34054330,PMC8153254,https://doi.org/doi:10.1007/s10618-021-00746-8

The rapid screening and preliminary diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection allow for the instant identification of possibly infected individuals and the subsequent mitigation of the disease spread. Herein, the detection of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals was explored using noninvasive sampling and low-preparatory-work analytical instrumentation. Hand odor samples were obtained from SARS-CoV-2-positive and -negative individuals. The volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were extracted from the collected hand odor samples using solid phase microextraction (SPME) and analyzed using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis (sPLS-DA) was used to develop predictive models using the suspected variant sample subsets. The developed sPLS-DA models performed moderately (75.8% (±0.4) accuracy, 81.8% sensitivity, 69.7% specificity) at distinguishing between SARS-CoV-2-positive and negative -individuals based on the VOC signatures alone. Potential markers for distinguishing between infection statuses were preliminarily acquired using this multivariate data analysis.

It is challenging to sample the lower airways non-invasively and the capability to identify a highly representative specimen that can be collected in a non-invasive way would provide opportunities to investigate metabolomic consequences of COVID-19 disease. In the present study, we performed a targeted metabolomic approach using liquid chromatography coupled with high resolution chromatography (LC-MS) on exhaled breath condensate (EBC) collected from hospitalized COVID-19 patients (COVID+) and negative controls, both non-hospitalized and hospitalized for other reasons (COVID-). We were able to noninvasively identify and quantify inflammatory oxylipin shifts and dysregulation that may ultimately be used to monitor COVID-19 disease progression or severity and response to therapy. We also expected EBC-based biochemical oxylipin changes associated with COVID-19 host response to infection. The results indicated ten targeted oxylipins showing significative differences between SAR-CoV-2 infected EBC samples and negative control subjects. These compounds were prostaglandins A2 and D2, LXA4, 5-HETE, 12-HETE, 15-HETE, 5-HEPE, 9-HODE, 13-oxoODE and 19(20)-EpDPA, which are associated with specific pathways (i.e. P450, COX, 15-LOX) related to inflammatory and oxidative stress processes. Moreover, all these compounds were up-regulated by COVID+, meaning their concentrations were higher in subjects with SAR-CoV-2 infection.

PO2tox is a mission limiting factor for special operations forces divers using closed-circuit rebreathing apparatus and a potential side effect for patients undergoing hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) treatment. In this study, we aim to determine if there is a specific breath profile of compounds in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) that is indicative of the early stages of pulmonary hyperoxic stress/PO2tox. Using a double-blind, randomized 'sham' controlled, cross-over design 14 U.S. Navy trained diver volunteers breathed two different gas mixtures at an ambient pressure of 2 ATA (33 fsw, 10 msw) for 6.5 h. One test gas consisted of 100% O2(HBO) and the other was a gas mixture containing 30.6% O2with the balance N2(Nitrox).

Simultaneous collection of breath VOCs and background environmental VOCs is important to ensure analyses eliminate exogenous compounds from clinical studies. We present a mobile sampling system to extract gaseous VOCs onto commercially available sorbent-packed thermal desorption tubes. The sampler can be connected to a number of commonly available disposable and reusable sampling bags, in the case of this study, a Tedlar bag containing a breath sample. Alternatively, the inlet can be left open to directly sample room or environmental air when obtaining a background VOC sample. The system contains a screen for the operator to input a desired sample volume. A needle valve allows the operator to control the sample flow rate, which operates with an accuracy of -1.52 ± 0.63% of the desired rate, and consistently generated that rate with 0.12 ± 0.06% error across repeated measures. A flow pump, flow sensor and microcontroller allow volumetric sampling, as opposed to timed sampling, with 0.06 ± 0.06% accuracy in the volume extracted. Four samplers were compared by sampling a standard chemical mixture, which resulted in 6.4 ± 4.7% error across all four replicate modular samplers to extract a given VOC. The samplers were deployed in a clinical setting to collect breath and background/environmental samples, including patients with active SARS-CoV-2 infections, and the device could easily move between rooms and can undergo required disinfection protocols to prevent transmission of pathogens on the case exterior. All components required for assembly are detailed and are made publicly available for non-commercial use, including the microcontroller software.

We report for the first time a safe and consistent method to fully inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in EBC samples and make EBC samples safe for processing and analysis. EBC samples containing infectious SARS-CoV-2 were treated with several concentrations of acetonitrile. The most commonly used 10% acetonitrile treatment for EBC processing failed to completely inactivate the virus in samples and viable virus was detected by the assay of SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero E6 cells in a biosafety level 3 laboratory. Treatment with either 50% or 90% acetonitrile was effective to completely inactivate the virus, resulting in safe, non-infectious EBC samples that can be used for metabolomic analysis.

In this pilot study, we characterized the metabolic composition of human breath for an early diagnosis and differentiation of influenza viral infection, as well as other types of upper respiratory viral infections. We first studied the non-specific effects of planned seasonal influenza vaccines on breath metabolites in healthy subjects after receiving the immunization. We then investigated changes in breath content from hospitalized patients with flu-like symptoms and confirmed upper respiratory viral infection. The exhaled breath was sampled using a custom-made breath condenser, and exhaled breath condensate (EBC) samples were analysed using liquid chromatography coupled to quadruplole-time-of-flight mass spectrometer (LC-qTOF). All metabolomic data was analysed using both targeted and untargeted approaches to detect specific known biomarkers from inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers, as well as new molecules associated with specific infections. We were able to find clear differences between breath samples collected before and after flu vaccine administration, together with potential biomarkers that are related to inflammatory processes and oxidative stress. Moreover, we were also able to discriminate samples from patients with flu-related symptoms that were diagnosed with confirmatory respiratory viral panels (RVPs). RVP positive and negative differences were identified, as well as differences between specific viruses defined.

In commercial nurseries, asymptomatic infections of nursery stock by P. ramorum and other Phytophthora species create unacceptable risk and complicate inspection and certification programs designed to prevent introduction and spread of these pathogens. In this study, we continue development of a volatile organic compound (VOC)-based test for detecting asymptomatic infections of P. ramorum in Rhododendron sp. We confirmed detection of P. ramorum from volatiles collected from asymptomatic root-inoculated Rhododendron plants in a nursery setting, finding that the VOC profile of infected plants is detectably different from that of healthy plants, when measured from both ambient VOC emissions and VOCs extracted from leaf material. Predicting infection status was successful from ambient volatiles, which had a mean area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.71 ± 0.17, derived from corresponding receiver operating characteristic curves from an extreme gradient boosting discriminant analysis. This finding compares with that of extracted leaf volatiles, which resulted in a lower AUC value of 0.51 ± 0.21. In a growth chamber, we contrasted volatile profiles of asymptomatic Rhododendron plants having roots infected with one of three pathogens: P. ramorum, P. cactorum, and Rhizoctonia solani. Each pathogen induced unique and measurable changes, but generally the infections reduced volatile emissions until 17 weeks after inoculation, when emissions trended upward relative to those of mock-inoculated controls.

Although many breath sample collection and analytical methods have been developed for breath analysis, analysis of metabolic VOCs in exhaled breath is still a challenge for clinical application. Many carbonyl compounds in exhaled breath are related to the metabolic processes of diseases. This work reports a method of ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) for the analysis of a broad range of carbonyl metabolites in exhaled breath. Carbonyl compounds in the exhaled breath were captured by a fabricated silicon microreactor with a micropillar array coated with 2-(aminooxy)ethyl-N,N,N-trimethylammonium (ATM) triflate. A total of six subgroups consisting of saturated aldehydes and ketones, hydroxy-aldehydes, and hydroxy-ketones, unsaturated 2-alkenals, and 4-hydroxy-2-alkenals were identified in the exhaled breath.

Here, we describe partial ORF1ab gene target failure (pOGTF) on the cobas SARS-CoV-2 assays, defined by a ≥2-thermocycle delay in detection of the ORF1ab gene compared to that of the E-gene. We demonstrate that pOGTF is 98.6% sensitive and 99.9% specific for SARS-CoV-2 lineage BA.2.12.1, an emerging variant in the United States with spike L452Q and S704L mutations that may affect transmission, infectivity, and/or immune evasion. Increasing rates of pOGTF closely mirrored rates of BA.2.12.1 sequences uploaded to public databases, and, importantly, increasing local rates of pOGTF also mirrored increasing overall test positivity.

To better understand viral dynamics in BEs, this study assesses viromes from 11 habitats across four types of BEs with low to high occupancy. The diversity, composition, metabolic functions, and lifestyles of the viromes are found to be habitat dependent. Caudoviricetes species are ubiquitous on surface habitats in the BEs, and some of them are distinct from those present in other environments. Antimicrobial resistance genes are identified in viruses inhabiting surfaces frequently touched by occupants and in viruses inhabiting occupants' skin. Diverse CRISPR/Cas immunity systems and anti-CRISPR proteins are found in bacterial hosts and viruses, respectively, consistent with the strongly coupled virus-host links.

The objective of this study was to assess the utility of 24-hour composites as representative samples for measuring multiple microbiological targets in wastewater, and whether normalization of SARS-CoV-2 by endogenous targets can be used to decrease hour to hour variability at different watershed scales. Two sets of experiments were conducted, in tandem with the same wastewater, with samples collected at the building, cluster, and community sewershed scales. The first set of experiments focused on evaluating degradation of microbiological targets: SARS-CoV-2, Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) - a surrogate spiked into the wastewater, plus human waste indicators of Pepper Mild Mottle Virus (PMMoV), Beta-2 microglobulin (B2M), and fecal coliform bacteria (FC). The second focused on the variability of these targets from samples, collected each hour on the hour. Results show that SARS-CoV-2, PMMoV, and B2M were relatively stable, with minimal degradation over 24-h. SIV, which was spiked-in prior to analysis, degraded significantly and FC increased significantly over the course of 24 h, emphasizing the possibility for decay and growth within wastewater. Hour-to-hour variability of the source wastewater was large between each hour of sampling relative to the variability of the SARS-CoV-2 levels calculated between sewershed scales; thus, differences in SARS-CoV-2 hourly variability were not statistically significant between sewershed scales. Results further provided that the quantified representativeness of 24-h composite samples (i.e., statistical equivalency compared against hourly collected grabs) was dependent upon the molecular target measured. Overall, improvements made by normalization were minimal within this study. Degradation and multiplication for other targets should be evaluated when deciding upon whether to collect composite or grab samples in future studies.",The Science of the total environment,2023,primary,doi:10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.161423,36623667,PMC9817413,https://doi.org/doi:10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.161423

In this study, we analyzed SARS-CoV-2 and indicators of human waste in wastewater from two sewersheds of different scales: a University campus and a wastewater treatment plant. Wastewater data were combined with complementary COVID-19 case tracking to evaluate the efficiency of wastewater surveillance for forecasting new COVID-19 cases and, for the larger scale, hospitalizations. Results show that the normalization of SARS-CoV-2 levels by PMMoV and B2M resulted in improved correlations with COVID-19 cases for campus data using volcano second generation (V2G)-qPCR chemistry (r s = 0.69 without normalization, r s = 0.73 with normalization).

We then further evaluated the five algorithms with the highest accuracy, with the city and continental accuracy ranging from 85-89% to 90-94%, respectively. Thereafter, we used these results to develop Cassandra, a random-forest-based classifier that identifies bioindicator species to aid in fingerprinting and can infer higher-order microbial interactions at each site. We further tested the Cassandra algorithm on the Tara Oceans dataset, the largest collection of marine-based microbial genomes, where it classified the oceanic sample locations with 83% accuracy.

Any contaminating DNA that is introduced in the sample after tagging can then be bioinformatically identified and removed.

Non-potable water reuse represents the largest potential reuse market. Yet economic constraints for new water reuse infrastructure and safety concerns due to microbial water quality, and especially viral pathogen exposure, limit widespread implementation of water reuse. Cost-effective, real-time methods to measure or indicate viral quality of recycled water would do much to instill greater confidence in the practice. This manuscript discusses advancements in monitoring and modeling of viral health risks in the context of water reuse. First, we describe the current wastewater reclamation processes and treatment technologies with an emphasis on virus removal. Second, we review technologies for the measurement of viruses, both culture- and molecular-based, along with their advantages and disadvantages. We introduce promising viral surrogates and specific pathogenic viruses that can serve as indicators of viral risk for water reuse. We suggest metagenomic analyses for viral screening and flow cytometry for quantification of virus-like particles as new approaches to complement more traditional methods. Third, we describe modeling to assess health risks through quantitative microbial risk assessments (QMRAs), the most common strategy to couple data on virus concentrations with human exposure scenarios. We then explore the potential of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to incorporate suites of data from wastewater treatment processes, water quality parameters, and viral surrogates. We recommend ANNs as a means to utilize existing water quality data, alongside new complementary measures of viral quality, to achieve cost-effective strategies to assess risks associated with infectious human viruses in recycled water. Given the review, we conclude that technologies are ready for identifying and implementing viral surrogates for health risk reduction in the next decade. Incorporating modeling with monitoring data would likely result in more robust assessment of water reuse risk.",Water,2022,primary,doi:10.3390/w14081187,37622131,PMC10448804,https://doi.org/doi:10.3390/w14081187

The current gold standard for molecular diagnostics is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), but the extraordinary and unmet demand for testing in a variety of environments means that both complementary and supplementary testing solutions are still needed. This review highlights the role that loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has had in filling this global testing need, providing a faster and easier means of testing, and what it can do for future applications, pathogens, and the preparation for future outbreaks. This review describes the current state of the art for research of LAMP-based SARS-CoV-2 testing, as well as its implications for other pathogens and testing. The authors represent the global LAMP (gLAMP) Consortium, an international research collective, which has regularly met to share their experiences on LAMP deployment and best practices; sections are devoted to all aspects of LAMP testing, including preanalytic sample processing, target amplification, and amplicon detection, then the hardware and software required for deployment are discussed, and finally, a summary of the current regulatory landscape is provided. Included as well are a series of first-person accounts of LAMP method development and deployment. The final discussion section provides the reader with a distillation of the most validated testing methods and their paths to implementation.

Where the pandemic has been controlled, extremely high rates of diagnostic testing for the SARS-CoV-2 virus have proven critical, enabling isolation of cases and contact tracing. Recently, diagnostic testing has been supplemented with wastewater measures to evaluate the degree to which communities have infections. Whereas much testing has been done through traditional, centralized, clinical, or environmental laboratory methods, point-of-care testing has proven successful in reducing time to result. As the pandemic progresses and becomes more broadly distributed, further decentralization of diagnostic testing will be helpful to mitigate its spread. This will be particularly both challenging and critical in settings with limited resources due to lack of medical infrastructure and expertise as well as requirements to return results quickly. In this article, we validate the tiny isothermal nucleic acid quantification system (TINY) and a novel loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP)-based assay for the point-of-care diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans and also for in-the-field, point-of-collection surveillance of wastewater. The TINY system is portable and designed for use in settings with limited resources. It can be powered by electrical, solar, or thermal energy and is robust against interruptions in services. These applied testing examples demonstrate that this novel detection platform is a simpler procedure than reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and moreover, this TINY instrument and LAMP assay combination has the potential to effectively provide both point-of-care diagnosis of individuals and point-of-collection environmental surveillance using wastewater.",Journal of biomolecular techniques : JBT,2021,primary,doi:10.7171/jbt.21-3203-019,35136383,PMC8802758,https://doi.org/doi:10.7171/jbt.21-3203-019

We report here on lessons learned from establishing a WBS program for SARS-CoV-2 integrated with a human surveillance program for COVID-19. We have established WBS at three campuses of a university, including student residential dormitories and a hospital that treats COVID-19 patients. Lessons learned from this WBS program address the variability of water quality, new detection technologies, the range of detectable viral loads in wastewater, and the predictive value of integrating environmental and human surveillance data. Data from our WBS program indicated that water quality was statistically different between sewer sampling sites, with more variability observed in wastewater coming from individual buildings compared to clusters of buildings. A new detection technology was developed based upon the use of a novel polymerase called V2G. Detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater varied from 102 to 106 genomic copies (gc) per liter of raw wastewater (L). Integration of environmental and human surveillance data indicate that WBS detection of 100 gc/L of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater was associated with a positivity rate of 4% as detected by human surveillance in the wastewater catchment area, though confidence intervals were wide (β ~ 8.99 ∗ ln(100); 95% CI = 0.90-17.08; p < 0.05). Our data also suggest that early detection of COVID-19 surges based on correlations between viral load in wastewater and human disease incidence could benefit by increasing the wastewater sample collection frequency from weekly to daily. Coupling simpler and faster detection technology with more frequent sampling has the potential to improve the predictive potential of using WBS of SARS-CoV-2 for early detection of the onset of COVID-19.",The Science of the total environment,2021,primary,doi:10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.149177,34375259,PMC8294117,https://doi.org/doi:10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.149177

Beginning in early 2021, we implemented a targeted approach to amplify and sequence the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-COV-2 to characterize viral lineages present in sewersheds. Over the course of 2021, we reproducibly detected multiple SARS-COV-2 RBD lineages that have never been observed in patient samples in 9 sewersheds located in 3 states in the USA. These cryptic lineages contained between 4 to 24 amino acid substitutions in the RBD and were observed intermittently in the sewersheds in which they were found for as long as 14 months. Many of the amino acid substitutions in these lineages occurred at residues also mutated in the Omicron variant of concern (VOC), often with the same substitutions. One of the sewersheds contained a lineage that appeared to be derived from the Alpha VOC, but the majority of the lineages appeared to be derived from pre-VOC SARS-COV-2 lineages. Specifically, several of the cryptic lineages from New York City appeared to be derived from a common ancestor that most likely diverged in early 2020. While the source of these cryptic lineages has not been resolved, it seems increasingly likely that they were derived from long-term patient infections or animal reservoirs.

Efforts have been made to use the wastewater SARS-CoV-2 viral load to predict the infected population within each sewershed using a multivariable regression approach. However, reported clear and sustained variability in SARS-CoV-2 viral load among treatment facilities receiving industrial wastewater have made clinical prediction challenging. Several classes of molecules released by regional industries and manufacturing facilities, particularly the food processing industry, can significantly suppress the SARS-CoV-2 signals in wastewater by breaking down the lipid-bilayer of the membranes. Therefore, a systematic ranking process in conjugation with metabolomic analysis was developed to identify the wastewater treatment facilities exhibiting SARS-CoV-2 suppression and identify and quantify the chemicals suppressing the SARS-COV-2 signals. By ranking the viral load per diagnosed case among the sewersheds, we successfully identified the wastewater treatment facilities in Missouri, USA that exhibit SARS-CoV-2 suppression (significantly lower than 5 × 1011 gene copies/reported case) and determined their suppression rates. Through both untargeted global chemical profiling and targeted analysis of wastewater samples, 40 compounds were identified as candidates of SARS-CoV-2 signal suppressors. Among these compounds, 14 had higher concentrations in wastewater treatment facilities that exhibited SARS-CoV-2 signal suppression compared to the unsuppressed control facilities. Stepwise regression analyses indicated that 4-nonylphenol, palmitelaidic acid, sodium oleate, and polyethylene glycol dioleate are positively correlated with SARS-CoV-2 signal suppression rates. Suppression activities were further confirmed by incubation studies, and the suppression kinetics for each bioactive compound were determined. According to the results of these experiments, bioactive molecules in wastewater can significantly reduce the stability of SARS-CoV-2 genetic marker signals. Based on the concentrations of these chemical suppressors, a correction factor could be developed to achieve more reliable and unbiased surveillance results for wastewater treatment facilities that receive wastewater from similar industries.",Water research,2022,primary,doi:10.1016/j.watres.2022.118824,35830746,PMC9253601,https://doi.org/doi:10.1016/j.watres.2022.118824

Pathogen surveillance systems faced pressure to quickly establish response protocols, offering an opportunity to employ wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) for population-level monitoring. The pilot study reported herein aimed to: (i) develop a reliable protocol for MPXV DNA detection in wastewater which would reduce false negative reporting, (ii) test this protocol on wastewater from various regions across the United States, and (iii) conduct a state of the science review of the current literature reporting on experimental methods for MPXV detection using WBE. Twenty-four-hour composite samples of untreated municipal wastewater were collected from the states of New Jersey, Georgia, Illinois, Texas, Arizona, and Washington beginning July 3rd, 2022 through October 16th, 2022 (n = 60). Samples underwent vacuum filtration, DNA extraction from captured solids, MPXV DNA pre-amplification, and qPCR analysis. Of the 60 samples analyzed, a total of eight (13%) tested positive for MPXV in the states of Washington, Texas, New Jersey, and Illinois. The presence of clade IIb MPXV DNA in these samples was confirmed via Sanger sequencing and integration of pre-amplification prior to qPCR decreased the rate of false negative detections by 87% as compared to qPCR analysis alone. Wastewater-derived detections of MPXV were compared to clinical datasets, with 50% of detections occurring as clinical cases were increasing/peaking and 50% occurring as clinical cases waned. Results from the literature review (n = 9 studies) revealed successful strategies for the detection of MPXV DNA in wastewater, however also emphasized a need for further method optimization and standardization.

doi:10.1101/2022.09.25.22280344,Impact of sample clarification by size exclusion on virus detection and diversity in wastewater-based epidemiology.,"The use of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) for early detection of virus circulation and response during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic increased interest in and use of virus concentration protocols that are quick, scalable, and efficient. One such protocol involves sample clarification by size fractionation using either low-speed centrifugation to produce a clarified supernatant or membrane filtration to produce an initial filtrate depleted of solids, eukaryotes and bacterial present in wastewater (WW), followed by concentration of virus particles by ultrafiltration of the above. While this approach has been successful in identifying viruses from WW, it assumes that majority of the viruses of interest should be present in the fraction obtained by ultrafiltration of the initial filtrate, with negligible loss of viral particles and viral diversity. We used WW samples collected in a population of ~700,000 in southwest USA between October 2019 and March 2021, targeting three non-enveloped viruses (enteroviruses [EV], canine picornaviruses [CanPV], and human adenovirus 41 [Ad41]), to evaluate whether size fractionation of WW prior to ultrafiltration leads to appreciable differences in the virus presence and diversity determined. We showed that virus presence or absence in WW samples in both portions (filter trapped solids [FTS] and filtrate) are not consistent with each other. We also found that in cases where virus was detected in both fractions, virus diversity (or types) captured either in FTS or filtrate were not consistent with each other. Hence, preferring one fraction of WW over the other can undermine the capacity of WBE to function as an early warning system and negatively impact the accurate representation of virus presence and diversity in a population.",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,2022,primary,doi:10.1101/2022.09.25.22280344,36203558,PMC9536034,https://doi.org/doi:10.1101/2022.09.25.22280344

The public health response has been predominantly informed by surveillance of symptomatic individuals and contact tracing, with quarantine, and other preventive measures have then been applied to mitigate further spread. Non-traditional methods of surveillance such as genomic epidemiology and wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) have also been leveraged during this pandemic. Genomic epidemiology uses high-throughput sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genomes to inform local and international transmission events, as well as the diversity of circulating variants. WBE uses wastewater to analyse community spread, as it is known that SARS-CoV-2 is shed through bodily excretions. Since both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals contribute to wastewater inputs, we hypothesized that the resultant pooled sample of population-wide excreta can provide a more comprehensive picture of SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity circulating in a community than clinical testing and sequencing alone. In this study, we analysed 91 wastewater samples from 11 states in the USA, where the majority of samples represent Maricopa County, Arizona (USA). With the objective of assessing the viral diversity at a population scale, we undertook a single-nucleotide variant (SNV) analysis on data from 52 samples with >90% SARS-CoV-2 genome coverage of sequence reads, and compared these SNVs with those detected in genomes sequenced from clinical patients.

Despite the numerous benefits, sources of variability in sample storage, handling, and processing methods can make WBE data difficult to generalize. We performed an experiment to determine sources of variability in WBE data including the impact of storage time, handling, and processing techniques on the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater influent from three wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) in North Carolina over 19 days. The SARS-CoV-2 concentration in influent samples held at 4°C did not degrade significantly over the 19-day experiment. Heat pasteurization did not significantly impact the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 at two of the three WWTP but did reduce viral recovery at the WWTP with the smallest population size served. On each processing date, one filter from each sample was processed immediately while a replicate filter was frozen at -80°C. Once processed, filters previously frozen were found to contain slightly higher concentrations (<0.2 log copies/L) than their immediately processed counterparts, indicating freezing filters is a viable method for delayed quantification and may even improve recovery at WWTP with low viral concentrations. Investigation of factors contributing to variability during sample processing indicated that analyst experience level contributed significantly (p<0.001) to accepted droplet generation while extraction efficiency and reverse transcription efficiency contributed significantly (p<0.05) to day-to-day SARS-CoV-2 variability.
