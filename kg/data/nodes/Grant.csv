U01AA029345,Rolosense: An innovative platform for automatic mobile phone readout of active SARS-CoV-2 particles,"The ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop a novel platform technology for automatic surveillance
and tracing of airborne SARS-CoV-2 virus particles in real time. The centerpiece of this proposal is the
“Rolosense” technology which leverages a DNA micromotor as the virus sensing and transduction
material (VSTM) that can be detected by a conventional smart phone camera. This provides both
geographical tracing and surveillance. Rolosense motor are comprised a DNA-coated spherical particle
(5 micrometer diameter) that hybridizes to a surface modified with complementary RNA. The particle
moves at speeds of over 1 micron/minute upon the addition of RNase H, which selectively hydrolyses
hybridized RNA but not single-stranded RNA. DNA motors coated with virus binding ligand (VBL) stall
in presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus particles. Because motors move autonomously for distances up to
millimeters without intervention, the assay is fully automated, and conventional steps such as viral
inactivation, RNA isolation and amplification are not required. The readout is performed using an
automated smart phone app for particle tracking without the need for a spectrophotometer or
fluorometer. Preliminary data shows realtime SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus particle sensing. Milestones
include the screening and identification of high affinity and high specificity VBLs. Both aptamers and
antibody VBLs will be screening and validated. Simulations and experiments will be used to understand
the role of temperature and environmental conditions in modulating Rolosense performance.
Multivalent display of VBLs with DNA origami will enhance avidity. Finally, microfluidic chips with
airborne droplet capture will be implemented and tested. The work will be performed by a highly
interdisciplinary team with complementary expertise and a track-record of co-publications. PI Salaita
invented the Rolosense technology and has past experience in developing cell phone diagnostics and
synthetic motors. Co-I Melikian is an expert virologist, Co-I Heemstra is an expert at developing
aptamers for novel targets, Co-I Ke has extensive experience in DNA origami structures for avid target
binding and has co-authored work on Rolosense, Co-I Rajaraman and Primordia are experts at
microfluidic device development and commercialization. Our solution offers the potential to provide an
immediate solution to today’s urgent virus sensing and tracing needs.","Public Health Statement/Narrative
The aim of this proposal is to help reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus by
developing a surveillance technology that allows for realtime and fully automated viral
sensing. The approach uses a smart phone camera to detect the displacement of
motors that are highly sensitive to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.",Non-SBIR/STTR,U01,RADx-rad,Automatic Detection & Tracing
U18TR003793,Microfluidic Isolation and Characterization of SARS-CoV-2 and Virus Related Exosomes,"Robust, efficient and reliable testing for SARS-CoV-2 is extraordinarily challenging due to our lack of ultra-
sensitive assays and ever evolving knowledge of the virus. Standard PCR based assays still result in very high
false negative rates in the earliest days of infection. Microfluidic processing of clinical samples is low cost and
shows great promise for translating most liquid biopsy assay to the clinic. Our laboratory was one of the first to
apply microfluidic technologies for the isolation of both circulating tumor cells and exosomes in the blood of
patients with cancer. For SARS-CoV-2 patients, saliva, stool, and plasma are all thought to be potential resources
for both virus detection as well as other clinical biomarkers that might inform us of infection. Thus, for this U18,
we will optimize our exosome capture technology, the EVHB-Chip, for the isolation of intact SARS-CoV-2 virus,
testing its utility for each of these biofluids. To complete this work, we will complete a full clinical validation and
benchmarking of the assay. Once fully optimized, our detection assay will be compared against existing EUA
SARS-CoV-2 detection assay to determine detection sensitivity and specificity. Further, we plan to demonstrate
that the increased sensitivity and specificity enabled by our microfluidic device will result in earlier detection of
SARS-CoV-2, reducing false negatives in this testing window. At the completion of this work, we will have
collected the data training sets and submitted a full EUA plan that would enable the FDA’s authorization of our
test to be used in the clinic.","We will develop a SARS-CoV-2 detection assay using our existing microfluidic exosome isolation technology,
the EVHB-Chip. The high sensitivity and specificity of our technology allows for the isolation of rare nanoscale
vesicles from complex biofluids. Based on our early data, we believe it is ideally suited for the isolation of SARS-
CoV-2 virus particles and have established a strong team of collaborators to rapidly and efficiently lead us
through assay development, validation, and clinical integration.",Other Research-Related,U18,RADx-rad,Exosome
U01DA053949,Optimizing SARS-CoV-2 wastewater based surveillance in urban and university campus settings.,"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is causing significant morbidity and mortality. Current approaches to SARS-
CoV-2 testing are costly, inconsistently implemented, and fail to rapidly identify evolving outbreaks. Innovative
surveillance programs are urgently needed to better measure baseline transmission dynamics and anticipate
new localized outbreaks. Wastewater based testing (WBT) has the potential to enable population level
surveillance, trigger earlier regional responses to acute outbreaks, and overcome barriers to individual testing
such as stigma and lack of access. WBT could therefore enable faster and cheaper pathogen detection and
improve population-level estimates of prevalence. Reliable capture approaches for this novel coronavirus using
WBT are currently undefined. Viral dynamics during wastewater transport must be considered, and correlation
of WBT with clinical testing must be systematically evaluated at multiple scales. Here, we propose to optimize
WBT surveillance protocols of waste streams at an urban university campus encompassing dorms, research
facilities and a tertiary care hospital, surrounding sewershed and wastewater treatment plant. We will detect
SARS-CoV-2 using qRT-PCR to estimate prevalence and viral panel-enriched metatranscriptomics to
characterize viral diversity. We will model case counts using normalized WBT data and develop point-of-use
microfluidics systems for WBT. Our team of investigators is uniquely positioned for this study, with expertise in
infectious diseases, epidemiology, microbial characterization using WBT at national scales, and point-of-care
testing. We will implement three complimentary specific aims. In Aim 1, we will optimize (1a) collection and
processing to determine sensitivity and safety of WBT. This includes grab vs. composite sampling;) filtration- vs.
precipitation-based enrichment; and viral inactivation protocols. We will further optimize scale and frequency of
sampling (1b) at the building/sewer pit, campus, sewershed, and WWTP, and across various frequencies.
Presence of SARS-CoV-2 will be ascertained by qRT-PCR and long-read spiked-primer enriched
metatranscriptomics. WBT results will be integrated with clinical case-loads, existing surveillance cohorts and
expanded employee surveillance. In Aim 2. we will improve modeling of SARS-CoV-2 case dynamics using
extrapolated WBT data and site-specific normalization factors. We will correlate modeled building-, campus- and
community-level case counts with existing clinical incidence data and campus surveillance using ensemble
Kalman filter (EnKF) dynamic modeling incorporating both qRT-PCR and metatranscriptomics data. We will
compare normalization methods factoring in wastewater residence time, per capita viral load equivalents
(PCVLEs), and other waste flow parameters to reduce model error. Finally, in Aim 3, we will adapt point-of-use
testing capabilities using microfluidics based on optimized WBT protocols. We will apply existing RADx
development of a photothermal amplification system for SARS-CoV-2 detection to optimized WBT practices. We
will develop a modular system for WBT samples and determine assay detection thresholds using viral controls.","Wastewater based testing (WBT) holds great promise for cost-effective population-level surveillance and
transmission tracking of SARS-CoV-2, but optimal sampling modalities and protocols are unknown. Taking
advantage of a diverse inner city urban campus encompassing undergraduate and postgraduate dorms,
research buildings, and medical facilities, we will optimize WBT surveillance strategies of waste streams at the
building level, surrounding sewersheds and wastewater treatment plants and model case counts using
normalized WBT data. We will further leverage metatranscriptomics for rapid identification of SARS-CoV-2
transmission chains and develop point-of-use microfluidics systems for timely WBT.",Non-SBIR/STTR,U01,RADx-rad,Wastewater

R33HD105594,Diagnosis of MIS-C in febrile children,"The recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and resultant pandemic of COVID-19 disease has overwhelmed global
health systems and led to over 200,000 American deaths to date. While initial reports suggested that SARS-
CoV-2 infection in children was generally benign, a novel post-inflammatory syndrome known as multisystem
inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has now been described. MIS-C in children is characterized by fever,
systemic inflammation, and end-organ involvement, and the majority of patients are IgG seropositive for SARS-
CoV-2. Because the clinical features of MIS-C overlap with other infections and inflammatory disorders, new
strategies for diagnosis of MIS-C in febrile children are urgently needed. Our immediate objective (during the
R61 phase) is to determine the reproducible changes in breath, urine, and salivary volatile composition in chil-
dren diagnosed with MIS-C. We will integrate these discovery studies with clinical and immunological profiling to
develop (during R61 phase) and validate (during R33 phase) a novel and much-needed MIS-C diagnostic, which
is expected to have a major impact on care of febrile children. Our long-term goal to develop a diagnostic strategy
to distinguish children with MIS-C from children with other causes of fever. Supported by our strong preliminary
data that indicate our expertise and feasibility of this strategy, our objectives will be met through three specific
aims: 1) Characterize breath biomarkers in children with MIS-C (R61); 2) Relate breath VOC changes to virolog-
ical, disease severity, and immunological features of MIS-C (R61); and 3) Validate our novel MIS-C diagnostic
for clinical use (R33). The proposed research is significant, because we will progress in development of new,
much-needed MIS-C rapid diagnostic tool.","This research is highly relevant to public health because there is no current validated
diagnostic tool for the post-SARS-CoV-2 inflammatory disorder in children, MIS-C. Our
proposal will develop a new strategy to diagnose this disorder, which will directly
improve care of children with fever and help support future clinical studies.",Non-SBIR/STTR,R33,RADx-rad,PreVAIL kIds
R01DC016112,A confectionary-based screening tool for assessing chemosensory loss in COVID 19 patients.,"The goals of this Emergency Competitive Revision are to develop (Aim 1) and deploy (Aim 2) a
novel, objective, psychophysical smell and taste screening test to detect the onset of COVID 19
in at-risk populations. Complementary to the temperature screening procedures currently in use,
this tool is predicted to promote early identification of COVID onset leading to better prognoses
and the early implementation of protocols to prevent community spread. Our specific plan is to
use a hard-candy containing different combinations of tastants and flavors that are easy to
distribute to a large population. During the development phase (Aim 1), this novel test will be
compared with the NIH toolbox to assess the acceptability and efficacy of the two methods. We
expect that the hard-candy assessment will be at least as efficacious in detecting chemosensory
loss but more acceptable to subjects. Aim 2 will entail daily self-monitoring of chemosensory
function in at-risk populations with data tracked through a secure online portal. The novelty of
this confectionary-based test is that it provides standard stimuli that can yield objective
measures of both the qualitative and quantitative aspects of smell (aroma and flavor) and taste
(sweet and sour). Moreover, both orthonasal and retronasal olfactory function will be
independently assessed. The test can be self-administered and the familiar, pleasant nature of
the stimuli should facilitate a high compliance rate, allowing for continuous monitoring over
prolonged periods. Moreover, the test is rapid and inexpensive. Data will be incorporated into a
predictive model for COVID 19 and assessed using AOC analyses of sensitivity and specificity.
OSU is a leading large public land grant university with a varied population of students, faculty,
and support staff that includes all health care specialties. These characteristics, along with the
University-mandated regular PCR testing of students and staff makes it a perfect site to perform
this urgent research.","This research will develop a novel screening tool for COVID 19 using chemosensory testing. Loss of smell
and/or taste is a predictive symptom of COVID 19 but current tests are not optimal for routine
assessment in large populations of individuals. The development of a confectionary-based test will allow
routine self-monitoring of chemosensory function using objective, sensitive, simple and inexpensive
procedures to identify potential cases of COVID 19.",Non-SBIR/STTR,R01,RADx-rad,Chemosensory Testing
R44DE030842,A scalable aptamer-based electrochemical biosensor for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 from saliva,"The COVID-19 pandemic is a critical global public health emergency and many countries are failing to contain
the virus's spread due to slow and insufficient testing. While several diagnostic methods are now available, most
tests are either reagent-intensive and must be done in CLIA-approved labs, making them expensive and slow to
report results, or rapid and inexpensive, but potentially lacking in sensitivity. In the U.S., seriously ill and high-
risk patients have been prioritized for testing, causing states to miss mild and asymptomatic cases, some of
which are the most effective spreaders of the virus. However, expanding testing has been a challenge due to
shortages of sampling swabs and key reagents for nucleic acid amplification-based tests, which are the most
popular option. Testing capabilities must be expanded exponentially to enable mass population-level testing of
all patients, healthcare workers and their families, other critical key workers, and the wider community in order
to bring the pandemic under control. mPOD proposes to expand testing capabilities through a novel biosensor
that will use oligonucleotide molecules called aptamers to bind to unique sites on the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Aptamers have similar binding affinities to antibodies, but due to their smaller size, they are more agile, making
them particularly suited for high-specificity binding. To complete the test, a saliva sample will be loaded onto a
test strip containing aptamers immobilized onto gold electrodes. The gold-electrode test strip will be inserted into
the mPOD DTCT, a proprietary electrochemical test platform where virus-bound aptamers will be detected via
cyclic voltammetry, triggering a positive result. The result is sent wirelessly via a mobile app, which sends
encrypted data on to the cloud for storage and to public health agencies for enhanced data collection, tracking,
and tracing of COVID-19. The app will also include a backend database to help businesses, manufacturers,
schools, and large institutions track tested individuals' results and tailor specific public health responses. In order
to further develop this technology and enable rapid deployment for timely COVID-19 intervention, mPOD plans
to 1) Select SARS-CoV-2-specific aptamers for use in electrode test strips with an optimized signal-to-noise ratio
performance, 2) Demonstrate sensitivity and specificity of a low-cost, miniaturized potentiostat test strip for use
as a COVID-19 POC or OTC diagnostic, 3) Complete and test a fully-fledged digital infrastructure for data
collection, tracking, and tracing of COVID-19 test results via the mPOD mobile app. This non-traditional approach
will provide new testing capabilities with the potential to report results faster than standard RT-PCR tests and
with greater accuracy and sensitivity compared to existing antigen-based diagnostics. Furthermore, once the
system is developed, test strips with customized aptamers can be developed for rapid diagnosis of other
pathogens, including future emerging pandemics, via routine POC and OTC testing.","Worldwide, healthcare systems are struggling to diagnose new COVID-19 cases in a timely manner and to
perform effective contract tracing to contain the pandemic. New diagnostic methods that are rapid, affordable,
sensitive, and don't draw from already overtaxed supply chains are necessary to meet the urgent need for point-
of-care and over-the-counter testing. To help meet this need, mPOD aims to develop a low-cost, aptamer-based
biosensor platform to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus in saliva, complete with an app that will facilitate data
collection, tracking, and tracing of COVID-19 cases.",SBIR/STTR,R44,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC
R44DE030852,Designer DNA Nanostructure Based Biosensing for Rapid COVID19 Detection and Monitoring using Saliva Sample,"A Novel Saliva-Based Aptamer Detection Assay for SARS-CoV-2 Infection
(RFA-OD-20-021 STTR Application)
Automated, rapid diagnostics with little sample collection and preparation are needed to identify
and trace affected persons in times when hyper-infectious pathogens cause pandemics. Frequent,
low cost and highly scalable testing is the only way to gain visibility on the magnitude of the
pandemic and ultimately control the spread of the disease. We propose the development of a
unique system that can cheaply and readily detect SARS-CoV-2 in saliva samples. The
development of a system that uses saliva present an opportunity to readily test patients using a
sample that is easily collected and harbors high concentration of viral particles.
The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has predominantly affected individuals with pre-existing conditions
such as clotting disorders, diabetes, hypertension or other chronic diseases. Patients with these
pre-existing conditions who then are infected have exacerbated symptoms and complications that
can lead to death. For example, many patients that have succumbed to SARS-CoV-2 infection
have developed blood clots that have impaired pulmonary or cardiac function and ultimately
cardiac failure. A rapid diagnostic using easily collected samples (e.g. saliva) would allow for
infections to be identified sooner, therapies to be administered quicker, treatment to be monitored,
and ultimately leading to fewer individuals that succumb to the infection.
We outline a novel DNA Star biosensing approach based on the fact that viruses, such as SARS-
CoV-2, express unique spatial patterns of antigens on their surfaces, facilitating multivalent
binding to host cells for infection. These configurations of epitopes drive the high sensitivity and
specificity of our assay. Based on this naturally occurring binding mechanism, we developed a
rational design approach producing pattern matching designer DNA architecture for viral sensing.
A proof-of-concept Dengue virus (DENV) rapid diagnostics was developed to demonstrate its
power: DENV surface antigens present the most complex geometric pattern among all known
pathogens, a DNA star linked 10-aptamers nanostructure that offers polyvalent, spatial DENV-
epitope pattern matching interactions has provided high DENV-binding avidity and specificity,
increasing affinity by ~1,000× compared to the conventional aptamer approach which relies on
monovalent aptamer-epitope interactions. Our POCT diagnostics detected intact DENV virions in
patient samples with PCR equivalent sensitivity in <2 mins at a cost <$0.15.
Current RT-PCR molecular test are suited to large, centralized laboratories, and difficult to scale
for rapid testing of samples and delivery of results to clinicians and patients. Immunoassay tests
have lower sensitivity, and patients need to develop a response to the virus in order to detect the
antibody response. Our “DNA star” biosensor-based rapid diagnostics will provide the
infrastructure for real time SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics that is easy to use (instrument-free), faster
(sample to results in minutes) and cost effective (~$3 per test).","Direct detection of viral pathogens is needed to help limit the spread of extremely contagious and lethal infectious
agents. Our aptamer-based detection assay and instrument will provide a mechanism to detect low levels of the
SARS-CoV-2 viral pathogen with an automatic system requiring minimal effort for sample collection and no
sample preparation and the system will be built to analyze at least 7 other sample types (plasma, whole blood,
urine, nasopharyngeal samples, etc.) and the detection modalities will have additional detection aptamers in
order to detect additional viral pathogens. This assay system can be deployed to monitor people not only in
hospital and senior living facilities, but in schools, airports and other locations so that infected and asymptomatic
individuals can be identified, quarantined, and treated to limit the spread of the pathogen.",SBIR/STTR,R44,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC
U18TR003780,Exosome-based Non-traditional Technologies Towards Multi-Parametric and Integrated Approaches for SARS-CoV-2,,"The urgent need to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2 demands availability of diagnostics that are more rapid,
accurate, sensitive and affordable than qPCR and antibody tests. Current qPCR tests are specific and sensitive,
but lengthy turnaround times limit interventions against disease spread. Antibody testing is faster, but false-
positive/negative rates are high. Here, we propose to repurpose extracellular vesicle (EV) separation and
characterization technologies into a fully automated SARS-CoV-2 testing platform that is low-cost, accurate,
sensitive, rapid (within 3 h), and practical. The device will be optimized to analyze blood, saliva, and
nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs collected at home, without risking transmission to healthcare workers. The sample
is processed with an automated device developed with Sognef, and data are transferred to the Sognef servers
for analysis through an app that can be downloaded to any smart device. This technology is similar to Abbott's
recently launched BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card, but has the advantage of multiparametric detection of viral
RNA (vRNA), including Spike (S) and Nucleocapsid (N) protein-coding regions, plus a panel of host EV
microRNAs (exomiRs) that reveals infection even when viral loads are below detectable limits. This approach
will decrease false-positives/negatives, the major limitation of antigen/antibody tests. Examine relationships of
miRNA panels with characteristics such as: symptomatic vs asymptomatic, qPCR-determined viral load,
biological sex, age (including pediatric populations), and comorbidities.
 We will optimize a COVID-19 device that uses simple bind-elute microfluidics for sample separation
followed by electrical, probe-based detection of i) all validated exomiRs from Aim 1 and ii) our three conserved
vRNAs. We envision that the device will be used first for either finger-pricked blood or saliva, followed, if positive,
by an optional confirmatory second test of NP swab viral transport medium (VTM) that could be done with the
same device. We will then test the device in multiple centers worldwide in two phases: Phase 1 – every center
will perform a double-blinded validation using their biorepository specimen, and Phase 2 – in a β-testing phase,
we will provide a large number of devices to healthcare providers for regular testing of workers.",Other Research-Related,U18,RADx-rad,Exosome
U01DA053899,"Improved scalability, sensitivity, and interpretability of pathogen detection, including SARS-CoV-2, in wastewater using high-throughput, highly multiplexed digital array PCR technology","Presently, the application of molecular technology such as RT-qPCR and digital PCR (dPCR) to quantify
SARS-CoV-2 and related targets in wastewater is cumbersome, time consuming, and costly. While
progress has been made on the development of methods and the interpretation of data, much remains to
be improved for the technology to be used as a public health management tool. A major drawback in the
current approaches are 1) the lack of streamlined and consistent pre-analytical processing steps, 2)
coverage across the relevant targets requires a high number of reactions (>20) from any single sample to
provide quantitative information, and 3) a lack of vision on the development of a pathogen/marker panel,
much like those used in clinical arenas, for interpretation of the data across different states, regions and
nations. The goal of this project will be to successfully navigate these three limitations toward
development of a public health warning system that is not dependent on clinical testing and has the ability
to rapidly address novel pathogen threats in the future.","The proposed research will enhance the usefulness of wastewater monitoring for pathogens to address

U01DC019579,Longitudinal At Home Smell Testing to Detect Infection by SARS-CoV-2,"Self-report of sudden loss of smell or taste substantially increases the odds of being infected with SARS-CoV-2
(10 – 37-fold). However, self-report of smell function is an unreliable predictor of smell loss. Based on our
experience developing smell tests with personalized algorithms for asymptomatic detection of Alzheimer's
disease, we created a self-administered easy to use “at home” 5-minute objective smell test to uncover
alterations in smell function unbeknownst to many individuals, and confer increased risk of infection by SARS-
CoV-2. Our new smell test consists of a physical smell card containing peel and sniff odor labels and a web-
based application. The disposable smell card reduces the risk that the smell test serves as a vector of
transmission to other patients, research staff, and to health care workers. Each participant accesses the web-
based app on their own smartphone, tablet, or computer. In our pilot studies, we validated each participant's
COVID status by extracting results of clinical SARS-CoV-2 RT PCR assays from electronic health records. The
smell test provides better area under the curve for SARS-CoV-2 infection (0.83 – 0.85) in both US and
Argentinian symptomatic patients (ages 19 - 87) than symptom tracking alone (0.66). We are expanding the
smell test from one smell card with three odors to 6 smell cards, each with 3 different odors (18 odors total).
Having six different versions of the smell card will afford longitudinal screening several times per week and
provide data to construct personalized thresholds for changes in olfactory function - each person serving as
their own control and monitoring for diminishment of their expected performance based on their personal
trajectory rather than being based on population norms. Here we propose to develop a native app to conduct
longitudinal COVID Smell Test (Aim 1), collect data on asymptomatic health care workers, symptomatic
patients, and undergraduates (Aim 2) and develop algorithms for the longitudinal smell test for personalized
thresholds, differentiate smell loss from COVID relative to influenza, and assess risk of developing pulmonary
disease in COVID infected patients (Aim 3). The Longitudinal COVID Smell Test is accessible, affordable, and
readily scalable. Effective screening with the COVID smell test will better inform students and employees if
they should not report to school or work, and seek an evaluation by a healthcare professional and molecular
testing at an early, often asymptomatic, stage of the disease.","Disturbances of smell and taste is the predominant symptom of infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is

ZIAES103366,SARS-CoV-2 Diagnostic/Prognostic Sequencing Method,"COVID-19 Diagnostics. Our proposed screening approach, if adopted by CLIA-compliant testing facilities with robotics, next generation sequencing and bioinformatics capability, would meet one important need among testing alternatives. It would provide the capability for testing tens of thousands of patient samples in a large bolus. It could allow accurate and fast-turnaround SARS-CoV-2 testing capacity at population scale, permitting massive scale monitoring of at-risk individuals with minimal processing delay. This method exploits the indexing of poly-adenylated RNA from both virus and host cells and allows the possibility of extracting many metrics at once (more flags = easier to detect) with the same upstream processing routine. This added information will be useful for interpreting variation in response to viral exposure for both positive and negative tests. Looking ahead, the technical improvements embodied by a successful NGS-based viral gRNA screening platform could reveal new means to establish strategic preparedness roadmaps for future pandemics. It would be a model for how new infectious disease screening platforms might be rapidly jump-started and developed.

R61HD105591,A data science approach to identify and manage Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and Kawasaki disease in pediatric patients,"Since the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic began, the emergence of an associated novel multisystem
inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has been reported. Interestingly, patients with MIS-C follow a
presentation, management and clinical course that are somewhat similar to that of patients with Kawasaki
disease (KD). Currently, the reason for such an overlap in clinical features and management is unclear and
whether this overlap is the result of a partially shared etiology or pathophysiology is the subject of fierce
debates. The degree of overlap implies that some of the clinical prediction tools that we have developed in the
past for KD could be repurposed to accelerate the development of clinical support decision tools for MIS-C. In
this study, we will first (R61 component) systematically address the overlap between KD and MIS-C and create
salient machine-learning based prediction models for diagnosis/identification (Aim #1), management (Aim #2),
and short- and long-term outcomes (Aim #3) of MIS-C based on our previously developed predictive models for
KD in a process akin to transfer learning. Secondly (R33 component), we will validate and evaluate the
performance and clinical utility of these models in a predictive clinical decision support system for the diagnosis
and management of pediatric patients presenting with features indicative of either MIS-C or KD. In this study we
will include 3 groups of patients: 1) patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection with MIS-C (CDC criteria) regardless of
whether they have overlapping signs of KD, 2) patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection investigated for but
eventually not diagnosed with MIS-C, and 3) patients with KD but without SARS-CoV-2 infection. Targeted data
will be collected from enrolled patients (900 for training and 450 for validation) for deep phenotyping and
biomarker measurements. Physician feedback on the predictions generated by the algorithm will be used to
establish clinical utility. Data required for model training will be accrued in the first two years of activity (R61
period of the grant); the development of algorithms and their internal validation will occur concurrently. In the
following 2 years (R33 period of the grant), we will perform external validation, establish clinical utility, add real-
time epidemiological surveillance data to the models and finally package, and certify the algorithms for future
deployment and for the integration in electronic health records. This project will be a collaboration with the
International Kawasaki Disease Registry (IKDR) Consortium. The IKDR Consortium has an active KD and
pediatric COVID registry in 35 sites across the world and the number of sites is currently expanding to 60+ sites.
More than 600 MIS-C patients have already been identified at IKDR centers, making this project clearly feasible
and perfectly positioning IKDR to perform this study. We strongly believe that the use of emerging data science
methods and of our previously developed algorithms in the context of KD, as opposed to focusing on MIS-C
patients alone, will boost our understanding of the etiology and pathophysiology of both MIS-C and KD and will
more rapidly lead to the emergence of data-driven management protocols for patients with MIS-C.","The primary objective of this study is to design and validate a predictive decision support
system for the identification, treatment and management of SARS-CoV-2 associated with multisystem
inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). To develop this system, we will adapt and retrain machine learning
algorithms which we have previously trained in patients with Kawasaki Disease, a pediatric inflammatory
vasculopathy with multiple similarities to MIS-C. This study, performed in collaboration with the International
Kawasaki Disease Registry (IKDR) consortium, will consist of two phases, first a large-scale data collection
and algorithm development effort and second, the prospective evaluation of the performance and clinical utility

U18TR003787,A Handheld Microchip for GC analysis of breath to screen for COVID-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented societal suffering and economic disruption. In the
United States, more than six million people have contracted COVID-19 and more than one hundred ninety
thousand patients have died of this disease to date. Although current COVID-19 diagnostic testing technologies
are critical for slowing the spread of the virus and preventing future outbreaks, they are not practical for field use.
Current diagnostic tests are cumbersome to perform because they use aqueous solutions, require multiple steps,
and hours-to-days to obtain results. Since the US began to reopen the economy in May, there has been a
significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a diagnostic
approach that is non-invasive, portable, and can rapidly provide test results.
 The overall goal of the project is to develop a mobile breath analysis technology for rapid screening for
COVID-19 using a handheld breath collection tool and a portable GC with a photoionization detector (PID). The
handheld tool will be a closed system for trapping select volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on a microfabricated
chip. The captured VOCs will be eluted with ethanol and then analyzed using a commercially available, portable
GC-PID instrument. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms will be applied to recognize the
VOC pattern that correlates with COVID-19 infection. The central innovation is the microfabricated chip that
captures carbonyl compounds in exhaled breath and thus serves as a preconcentrator, which enables analysis
of carbonyl VOCs by the portable GC-PID. The hypothesis is that the carbonyl metabolome in exhaled breath is
directly related to the body’s reaction to the novel coronavirus infection, and changes in the carbonyl VOC
composition in exhaled breath relative to healthy controls can be used to detect both symptomatic and
asymptomatic COVID-19 patients.
 Three specific aims are proposed to fulfill the overall goal. Aim 1 is to build a disposable handheld breath
analyzer tool for concentrating carbonyl VOCs. Aim 2 is to identify VOC patterns in the breath of COVID-19
patients by machine learning algorithms. Aim 3 is to integrate portable GC technology with the breath sampling
tool for COVID-19 screening guided by an AI system. The University of Louisville is uniquely suited to rapidly
transition the microchip technology to field use because of the PI and Co-PI’s experience in breath analysis and
translational research, and the project team’s experience in virology, infectious diseases, biostatistics, and
artificial intelligence as well as the state-of-the-art facilities that include a MicroNano Technology Center,
Biosafety Level 3 Regional Biocontainment Lab, and an NIH-funded REACH program.","8. Project Narrative
 This project will develop a mobile breath analysis technology for rapid screening for COVID-19 using a

machine learning algorithms will be used to analyze the detected signals of volatile organic compounds (VOCs)
in exhaled breath by the portable GC for detection of COVID-19 patients. UofL is uniquely suited to develop this

R42DE030829,A multimodal platform for Oral screening of COVID-19,"The development of a rapid and reliable sensor system from readily available oral specimens is crucial for
the screening and management of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Other than tests that require laboratory-scale
instrumentation, the development of rapid tests can play a timely role in the management of an outbreak.
Current rapid tests often involve the antibodies in a lateral flow format to detect viral protein components
and, depending on the implementation, can result in a relatively high degree of error. In partnership with
MIT, InnoTech proposes the development of a multiplexed sensor platform based on nanomaterials capable
of molecular binding and subsequent reporting. We will develop and commercialize a multiplexed sensor
platform using nanomaterial reporters capable of rapid simultaneous detection of multiple components of
viral particles in a field applicable electrochemical device. For our Phase I- Aim 1 we will focus on the
development and optimization of synthetic biosensors for accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins
and nucleic acid. Our milestone is the discovery and validation an array of molecular recognition biosensors
against both protein and nucleic acid segments of SARS-CoV-2. We will complete this phase in 4 months.
In Phase II-Aim 1, we will develop and validate the electrochemical detectors. We will utilize the synthetic
biosensors identified and validated in Aim 1 to an electrochemical platform for the rapid detection of an
active SARS-CoV-2 infection using multiple biomarkers of the infection. We will specifically employ
commercially-available, disposable electrode platforms and existing potentiostats from Metrohm DropSens
to streamline scale-up and commercialization. Our milestone, to be completed in year 1 of Phase II, is to
have a multiplex biosensor chip and an alpha prototype with a multiplex biosensor chip and a potentiostat
reader which we will benchmark for sensitivity and quantitative accuracy against existing COVID-19
diagnostics. In Phase II-Aim 2, we will validate the prototype chips and detectors with retrospective clinical
specimens in preparation for EUA-FDA submission. We will determine the LOD, clinical performance,
and cross-reactivity with other respiratory pathogens and normal flora. The milestone for this Aim is to
document a multiplex of at least two proteins and two nucleic acid biosensors for SARS-CoV-2 that will
provide a LOD of 5-20 viruses per microliter in an oral specimen and will be clinically validated with
greater than 95% concordance with RT-PCR in 30 positive and 30 negative specimens.","The development of rapid tests can play a timely role in the management of an outbreak. The
COVID-19 pandemic has been especially devastating due to the ability of asymptomatic carriers
to transmit the virus. Thus, accurate and low-cost detection of the active infection on-site from
easily collectible oral specimens is essential for the successful management of this disease.",SBIR/STTR,R42,RADx-rad,Novel Biosensing and VOC
U54HL119145,Boston Biomedical Innovation Center,"A well-recognized gap exists in the path from biomedical discovery in academia to clinical application and 
commercialization of therapeutic, device, and diagnostic technologies in cardiovascular, pulmonary, 
hematologic, and sleep disorders. This chasm is the result of inadequate funding for support of proof-of-concept 
or validation studies essential for early stage development; insufficient access to the resources and 
expertise needed to develop new technologies; and a lack of knowledge and experience among academic 
investigators in bringing new ideas to commercial realization. Within the partnering institutions included in 
this application, the essential elements exist with which to build the infrastructure needed to support and 
sustain the uninterrupted, durable flow of inventions from discovery through development and 
commercialization. While these institutions have a clear track record of remarkably successful development 
of many biomedical technologies, most of these commercial successes have been achieved by the tenacity 
of individual inventors rather than with the help of committed institutional mechanisms. We proposed to 
address these key shortcomings by establishing the regional Boston Center for Accelerated Innovation in 
Therapeutics, Devices, and Diagnostics for Heart, Lung, Blood, and Sleep Disorders (B-BIC, or the Boston 
Biomedical Innovation Center). The key objectives of this Center are to: 1) develop an integrated 
infrastructure that would expand the universe of commercializable technologies for heart, lung, blood, and 
sleep disorders; 2) place these opportunities in the proper evaluative context through an engagement (""seed 
it""), solicitation (""find it""), and selection (""pick it"") strategy; 3) efficiently and effectively bring those selected to 
an appropriate exit point from the development process; and 4) provide the educational and mentoring 
infrastructure necessary for the development of the proper entrepreneurial skills among academic 
innovators. By achieving these goals, B-BlC would change the culture of our academic environment, as 
well as the relationship between the public and private sectors in facilitating successful development 
strategies for technologies in heart, lung, blood, and sleep disorders for the ultimate benefit of patients and society.","Translation of basic observations into clinical practice is limited by the resources needed for development, 
inadequate experience of academic investigators, and the discovery-focused academic culture. Building an 
academic infrastructure that facilitates translation by promoting development is an important goal to ensure

R42DE030832,A SARS-CoV-2 Breathalyzer for Direct Virus Detection,"A substantial and growing body of evidence has demonstrated that COVID-19 is transmitted by human-emitted
airborne particles; therefore, it is critical to rapidly screen individuals to determine whether they are at risk of
transmitting the disease to others before they enter large venues (e.g., airports, schools) and smaller ones
where extended exposure or close proximity is expected (e.g., dental offices, hair salons). Given the large
number of asymptomatic cases of the disease, the infrared thermometers and health questionnaires frequently
used to screen individuals are plainly inadequate. Existing SARS-CoV-2 detection technology is time consum-
ing and complicated to use, expensive and not portable and therefore ill-suited to use as point of care (POC)
screening tools. Tests recently approved by the FDA under the Emergency Use Authorization face some of
the same challenges.
The goal of this project is to develop and test a novel breathalyzer for detecting aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 di-
rectly from exhaled breath in near real-time by marrying a proven, cutting-edge aerosol sampling technology
with a novel and inexpensive virus detector. The innovation is directly detecting virus in the breath, while other
breathalyzers depend on indirect detection (VOCs and AI algorithms) to infer the presence of the virus.
In this Fast-track STTR project, Aersol Devices Inc (ADev) will modify its commercial bioaerosol collector,
which is used to sample from the ambient environment, to enable it to collect viruses from breath samples into
a concentrated liquid sample. The University of Minnesota (UMN) will modify its Magnetic Particle Spectrome-
ter (MPS), a version of which has previously been used to detect Influenza A H1N1 virus, so that the liquid
samples from the collector can be analyzed to detect SARS-CoV-2.
Specific aims include developing the hardware for transforming an ambient sampler into a breath sampler, de-
signing a rapid means of decontaminating the collector between tests, integrating the collector and the detector
into a robust package, functionalizing magnetic nanoparticles with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, increasing the sig-
nal/noise ratio of the MPS electronics, reducing the assay time, improving the analytical sensitivity/specificity,
measuring the clinical sensitivity/specificity and comparing to RT-qPCR in pre-clinical testing.
The technology platform proposed is flexible and extensible and could be tailored to detect other pathogens
(e.g., rhinoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus other coronaviruses, etc.). This flexibility is
valuable since (1) this will not be the last pandemic (new pathogens in the future) and (2) development could
pivot to a different pathogen if a vaccine or other control measures bring the current COVID-19 pandemic un-
der control before this SARS-CoV-2 breathalyzer is commercially available.","Aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is a likely contributor to the rapid spread of COVID-19. Tools
are urgently needed for rapidly and inexpensively screening out contagious individuals before they
can enter schools, hospitals, office buildings, assisted living facilities, military installations and other
large venues in order to protect vulnerable populations and mitigate the pandemic. We will develop a
breathalyzer to detect aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 directly from exhaled breath within minutes by

R61HD105593,AICORE-kids: Artificial Intelligence COVID-19 Risk AssEssment for kids,"This work is directed at characterizing pediatric COVID-19 and stratifying incoming patients by projected
(future) disease severity. Such stratification has several implications: immediately improving treatment planning, and
as disease mechanistic pathways are uncovered, directing treatment. Predicting future severity will inform the risks of
outpatient treatment; to the patients themselves, their family, other caregivers/cohabitants, and to schools and
employers. As varying levels of “reopening” are adopted across the country (and the world), such prognostication will
inform policy on the handling of pediatric carriers in the community. Based on our preliminary analysis we assert that
a combination of novel assays including quantitative serology inflammatory markers (cytokine/chemokine profiles,
immune profiles), transcriptomics, epigenomics, longitudinal physiological monitoring, time series analysis, imaging,
radiomics and clinical observation including social determinants of health, contains adequate information even at early
stages of infection to stratify the disease and predict disease severity. We propose an artificial intelligence/machine
learning approach to integrate this rich and heterogeneous dataset, characterize the spectrum of disease and identify
biosignatures that predict severity in progressive disease. To facilitate translation of the approaches developed in this

Medicine and key to disease prevention for better health outcomes nationally and globally. In the area of
infectious disease prevention, real time and non-biased sequence data are essential for early detection of
threats to mitigate outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics. This proposed research project aims to innovate in
the creation and accessibility of metagenomic sequence data relating to infectious agents by leveraging the
potentially transformative tool of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE). The WBE approach employs analysis
of community wastewater from large populations to enable non-invasive, near real-time monitoring of both
symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. When combined with high-throughput metagenomic sequencing
(HTS), the resulting WBE-HTS approach is promising for detecting a broad spectrum of infectious agents
simultaneously without any a priori assumptions about virus identity or presence. This project will test the
hypothesis that the processing of aggregated metagenomic sequence data on viruses detectable in U.S.
wastewater can serve to identify vulnerabilities, outbreaks and epidemics early, thereby creating a novel and
potentially life-saving diagnostic approach for protecting public health.
 For hypothesis testing, the team will leverage Arizona State University's Human Health Observatory (HHO),
the largest sewage monitoring network and largest archive of sewage and sludge samples worldwide,
representing more than 200 U.S. cities and over 300 cities globally.
 The overall goal of this work is to develop a broadly applicable online bioinformatics framework and to
demonstrate its utility in a case study employing WBE and HTS.
 The three specific aims are to: (i) inventory viruses extant in the U.S. in a comprehensive database, using
existing database sources and WBE; (ii) generate a knowledge repository and online portal of metagenomic
data to support near real-time surveillance of the human–associated virome, and (iii) evaluate the utility of the
WBE bioinformatics framework for tracking viral outbreaks and epidemics.
 Successful completion of this project will provide the U.S. with an early warning system for pathogen
detection and outbreak tracking that can serve to prevent epidemics, thereby reducing morbidity and mortality
in the U.S. from contagious pathogens, first for viruses and potentially in the future for pathogenic bacteria and
other biohazards.","This biomedical informatics project will leverage high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data from U.S. wastewater
process flows collected over the past two decades to create an innovative early warning system for virus

allows a nearly infinite amount of sample volume and can be used at the point-of-care for rapid detection.
Fundamentally, breath also provides critical metabolomics information regarding how human body responds to

Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), a serious inflammatory condition presenting several
weeks after exposure to or infection with the virus. These presentations overlap in their clinical severity while
maintaining distinct clinical profiles. Public health and clinical approaches will benefit from an improved
understanding of the spectrum of illness associated with SARS CoV-2 and from the capacity to integrate data to
achieve two goals: (i) to identify the clinical, social, and biological variables that predict severe COVID-19 and
MIS-C, and (ii) to target those populations and individuals at greatest risk for harm from the virus. We propose
the COVID-19 Network of Networks Expanding Clinical and Translational approaches to Predict Severe Illness
in Children (CONNECT to Predict SIck Children) comprising eight partners providing access to data on >15
million children. Our network will systematically integrate social, epidemiological, genetic, immunological, and

from SARS-CoV-2 infection. To test our hypothesis, we will develop CONNECT to Predict SIck Children, a
network of networks that leverages inpatient, outpatient, community, and epidemiological data resources to
support the analysis of large data using machine learning and model-based analyses. For the R61 phase, we
will develop and refine predictive models using data from our network of networks (Aim 1). We will also recruit
participants previously diagnosed with either COVID-19 or MIS-C (along with appropriate controls who have had
mild or asymptomatic infections with SARS-CoV2), who will provide survey data (including social determinants)
and saliva and blood samples to identify persisting biological factors associated with severe disease (Aim 2). We
will iteratively assess our models using a knowledge management framework that considers the marginal value
of data for improving models' predictive capacity over time. In the R33 phase, we will validate and further refine
predictive models incorporating data from additional participants recruited throughout our network of networks,
including newly infected children with severe COVID-19 or MIS-C identified through real-time surveillance (Aim
3). We seek to develop predictive models for children and adolescents that are useful, sensitive to community

data to devise tests to distinguish children at risk of progression to severe COVID-19 or MIS-C and diagnostic
tests to distinguish these conditions from other causes of fever in children. Continuing our established
collaboration with Columbia University, we will define the antibody repertoire against all known human
coronaviruses and determine how pre-existing antibody to other coronaviruses may shape the immune
response in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and MIS-C. The first two years (R61) will build on the expertise of the
assembled teams to discover unique proteomic and transcriptomic patterns in MIS-C and SARS-CoV-2-

been established and will determine progression to the R33 phase. The final two years (R33) will focus on
platform development and multicenter and bi-national test validation to diagnose and predict severity in
children with SARS-CoV-2 infection or MIS-C based on aptamer technology, lateral-flow protein detection,
point-of-service RNA or antibody profiling with commercial partners. De-identified clinical and molecular data

have already been overcome: a) IRB-approved patient recruitment for data and samples is on-going, b) clinical
samples have been banked, c) strong preliminary data has been generated on RNAseq, aptamer proteomics,

settings and precise tracing with privacy protection of active infections. The fundamental limitations of current
gene-based assays stem from their reliance upon amplification and detection of the viral genetic materials
even if there were no intact/infectious viruses. These tests require labor-intensive, laboratory-based sample
preparation protocols for virus lysis, extraction of genetic materials, purification of the isolated materials,
thermal cycling for enzymatic amplification of viral nucleic acid sequences, and interpretation of complex
results by professionals. To accurately determine the infectivity of the infected individuals, contaminated
objects and environments, and provide guidance for patients, public and authorities to better manage treatment
and containment, we seek a new paradigm for rapid and direct pathogen detection and identification in which
the intact virions are directly recognized through their distinct surface epitope features, and the resultant
fluorescent signal is immediately captured by an end-user smartphone, followed by automatic data transition
and event tracing in a blockchain-encrypted manner. To achieve specific recognition of SARS-CoV-2 virions,
we customized a designer DNA nanostructure (DDN)-based capture probe that harbors a macromolecular
“net” whose vertices precisely match the intra- and inter-spatial pattern of SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike
glycoprotein clusters, and integrates a net-shaped array of SARS-CoV-2 spike specific-targeting aptamers.
This aptamer-DDN is designed for maximum affinity and specificity binding with spikes on intact virions in a
polyvalent and pattern-matching fashion. Once bound to intact virions, the DNA “nets” trigger the release of
fluorescence. This fluorescent signal can be readily and automatically detected by a membrane-shaped and
smartphone-based fluorimeter attached to the end-users' phone cameras. The acquired results will be
associated with user device IDs that are cyber-protected before tracing. We propose to combine DDN capture
probes and a smartphone device to develop and demonstrate a rapid, room temperature, single-step, virus-
specific, and ultrasensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus, in which the detection results can be acquired
within 5 minutes upon exposure, at the user end, allowing tracing the presence of viruses without affecting user
privacy. The signal to result transition, result to ID association, individual track and interacting network tracing
will be blockchain-encrypted to ensure information security for individual privacy, while tracing information
would be available to health authority for public health benefits.","The goal of the project is to develop a pipeline for automatic detection and tracing of active SARS-CoV-2
infection in a cost-effective, highly accurate, real-time, portable, and super-encrypted manner. Our integrated
approach first captures viral particles from patient samples to activate fluorescence reporters, followed by
signal detection using a smartphone fluorimeter, along with blockchain-based data processing and tracing. We
deployed designer DNA “net” nanostructures that match the spatial pattern of trimeric spike glycoprotein
clusters on the viral outer surface for specific and rapid SARS-CoV-2 virion detection, smartphone-based point-
of-care device for portable signal reading, and blockchain encryption for privacy protection during result
recording and track tracing, therefore, our detection and tracing model allows a direct, automatic, and cost-
effective detection, a highly flexible result acquisition process and a super-encrypted data transition and tracing

U01AA029328,Development of an Automated Diagnostic Platform for SARS-CoV-2 Monitoring in Vulnerable Areas,"The devastation caused by emerging pathogens with fast transmission capacity, such as SARS-CoV-2, has
demonstrated the importance of preparedness for future viral outbreaks; this includes the ability for fast
deployment of in-situ testing tools and epidemiological surveillance with high temporal and spatial
resolution; particularly in places that are most vulnerable to becoming reservoirs of infectious agents.
We propose to develop a versatile multiplexing detection platform for SARS-CoV-2 in saliva. The proposed
system will integrate signals from different biorecognition elements. Aptamer, antibody, and ACE2 will be
immobilized onto laser inscribed graphene electrodes, and detection mechanisms targeting SARS-CoV-2
spike protein will be studied under varying testing conditions (pH, temperature, ionic strength). After
determining the operating conditions for enhanced performance of each biosensor, a self-referencing
approach will be used between complementary recognition elements (i.e., possible combinations of
aptamers, antibodies, and ACE2 enzyme biosensors) to evaluate the effects on test results accuracy (i.e.,
risk of false-positive and false-negative results). A saliva pre-treatment protocol will be developed to
facilitate SARS-CoV-2 testing in human saliva using the multiplex biosensor platform. An open channel
microfluidics system will be designed to automatically split and channel a single saliva sample into multiple
streams to the biosensors without saturation, biofouling, and pump requirement. The development of a
functional and reliable multiplex biosensor system will be useful for addressing longstanding needs in public
health as the respiratory Coronavirus family continues its seasonal visits, which may repeat over several
decades, much like the occasional visits from the influenza virus, with varying degrees of virulence.","The proposed research aims to develop a multiplex biosensor platform to support increased

R44DE030841,Direct bioelectronic detection of SARS-CoV-2 from saliva using single-molecule field-effect transistor array,"Direct bioelectronic detection of SARS-CoV-2 from saliva
 using single-molecule field-effect transistor array
 Nucleic acid tests have become the gold-standard for diagnostic testing for COVID-19, usually performed
in specialized laboratories. Most are based on reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction
(qRT-PCR). The time required for specimen transport and processing results in a turnaround time that is typi-
cally several days. The few rapid (<1 hour) point-of-care (POC) tests are more expensive, still require sample
preparation and specialized reagents, and do not have the throughput needed for population surveillance. Di-
rect testing for the virus, which also reduces requirements for multiple reagents, is a necessary step to improv-
ing diagnostic testing. While four such antigen tests have been approved for detection of SARS-CoV-2 based
on immunoassays to the N protein, sensitivity is limited and no quantitation of viral load is possible.
 We will address this gap by using DiagnostikosTM, an in-development rapid POC platform for direct, real-
time, multiplexed, quantitative bioelectronic detection of biomolecules that employs an all-electronic detection
device that functions at the single-molecule level. These single-molecule field-effect transistors (smFETs) are
arrayed on a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) integrated circuit chip. Chips will interface
with an envisioned USB-stick-form-factor reader device. Robust single-domain antibodies, known as nanobod-
ies and immobilized on these devices, are used for sensitive detection of viral particles and viral debris. The
use of multiple nanobodies for a single protein and nanobodies for different proteins in a single assay allows
for significant improvements in specificity. Nanobodies will be specific for one or more of the four major struc-
tural proteins in SARS-CoV-2; the nucleocapsid (N) protein engulfing the viral RNA, the spike (S) protein, the
membrane (M) protein and the envelope (E) protein. No sample preparation or specialized reagents are re-
quired for detection, and the device will be designed to operate with saliva, which has very recently been
shown to be a reliable medium for detecting SARS-CoV-2. Individual sensor chips can be manufactured at a
cost of $35. With the addition of other nanobodies, these large dense arrays can also allow detection of many
pathogens in a single test.
 In this Direct-To-Phase-2 SBIR program we will pursue several key innovations that are required to make
such a platform possible, including isolation of nanobodies for key structure proteins of SARS-CoV-2 (Specific
Aim 1), development of the smFET platform for antigen detection (Specific Aim 2), development of large
CMOS arrays of these smFET devices (Specific Aim 3), and verification of detection in increasingly complex
samples up to and including clinical samples (Specific Aim 4). This project is a partnership between university
researchers who developed the smFET technology and a venture-based start-up venture, Quicksilver Biosci-
ences, spun out to commercialize smFET technology and develop smFET/CMOS arrays for molecular diag-
nostic applications.","The proposal seeks to provide a new bioelectronic approach for antigen testing for infectious diseases. Low-

evaluation of clinical severity and outcomes of COVID-19 disease in children are urgently needed.
The overarching goal of this grant proposal is to develop clinical assays that can evaluate and predict
severity of pediatric COVID-19 disease, ranging from asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic to severe
manifestations such as multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). To date, we have collected and
biobanked clinical samples from more than 400 patients across 3 academic hospitals, including
approximately 100 patients with MIS-C. In the first R61 phase of this project, we will continue to enroll
patients with pediatric COVID-19 and MIS-C for sample collection and longitudinal chart review and
testing (Aim 1), leverage machine learning to identify diagnostic and prognostic “omics” host
biomarkers based on RNA transcriptome profiling from nasal swab and whole blood samples (Aim 2)
and cell-free DNA analysis from plasma (Aim 3), and generate predictive models of clinical severity
and outcomes by incorporating longitudinal clinical, laboratory, viral, and omics data (Aim 4). Our
rationale for including these samples is that they are routinely obtained in hospitals and clinics and
permit easy and noninvasive collection without any special processing or handling requirements,
which will accelerate the development of omics-based clinical assays. Our Go/No-Go transition
milestones for transition to the R33 phase after 2 years include: (1) collection of longitudinal samples
from a minimum of 120 patients for each identified presentation (mildly symptomatic outpatient,
severely ill in the ICU, and MIS-C) and a comparable number of matched controls, (2) generation of
panels of candidate of severity and confirmation of a subset of biomarkers by qPCR, (3) development
of classifier models using machine learning using the biomarkers alone (for clinical assay
development), and (4) combining these omics biomarkers with additional clinical, viral, and laboratory
biomarkers into combined classifier models using machine learning. For the classifier models, the
minimum/goal performance requirements would be 70%/>80% sensitivity and 80%/>90% specificity.
In the second R33 phase, we propose to develop host-based clinical assays for diagnosis and
severity prediction of COVID-19-associated syndromes, including MIS-C, in children from nasal
swabs and blood (Aim 5) and validate these biomarker panels as a Laboratory Developed Test (LDT)
in a CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments) diagnostic laboratory (Aim 6). These
assays will be evaluated for accuracy, precision, reproducibility, limits of detection (LOD), matrix
effect, interference, among other performance characteristics. We will work closely with the RADx-rad

COVID-19 infection using the body odor signature of the disease. Our goal is to maximize societal impact
by creating a validated prototype that can be used in a community or workplace setting by minimally
trained personnel for low-cost, on-the-spot diagnosis within minutes. The system will be developed in a
manner that puts it on a pathway for rapid FDA approval. The Research Aims are:
Aim 1. Optimization, assembly, and integration of a prototype system with the ability to odor signature
of COVID-19 in samples of body odor. The system will be simple to use, pose essentially zero risk to the
operator and the test subject, and report a result within minutes. The production cost at scale will be
approximately $9,000 for the complete measurement system, with a per test cost of approximately $0.50. The
design and construction of the prototype will be conducted by Novo Engineering, a leading firm with extensive
experience in medical device development.
Aim 2. Software development. Software for the system from VOC sampling to final diagnostic result will be
developed to ensure error-free operation of the device. Our preliminary results suggest that simple linear
discriminant analysis (LDA) does an excellent job of classifying VOCs from human body odor as COVID-19
positive or negative (92% sensitivity and 87% specificity). Optimization of the sensor array (Aim 1) and use of
richer feature sets in our classifier models will lead to further performance improvements in the prototype system.
Aim 3. System Benchmarking and Validation. We will benchmark the full prototype system against a number
of VOC mixtures, with and without in vitro skin models. The system will undergo extensive testing against body
odor samples from individuals with pathological conditions other than COVID-19 and other sources of potentially
confounding VOCs. The prototype will be validated against 1000 samples drawn from the COVID-SAFE program
at Penn. The screening will include all members of the Penn community, and represents incredible racial and
ethnic diversity as well as a wide variance in age, sex, and gender.

to severe viral pneumonia, respiratory distress, acute kidney injury, thrombotic disorders, and serious cardiac,
cerebrovascular and vascular complications. Severe infection can also occur both in children and young adults
(< 21), and a significant proportion of children admitted with Covid-19 require ICU support, frequently including
mechanical ventilation. In addition, children and adolescents with initially asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection
have presented with a rare, but very severe multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). Epidemiologic, clinical
and laboratory predictors of progression towards severe forms of acute infection with SARS-CoV-2 and MIS-C
are thus urgently needed in the fight against Covid-19 in this population. As defined in the NIH Rapid
Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx) program, biomarker discovery can enable risk stratification and guide
interventional studies to target Covid-19 patients at enhanced risk of developing complications and/or severe
disease. To target this discovery initiative, herein we will use a battery of biological, immunological and molecular
tests, including Grating-Coupled Fluorescence Plasmonic (GCFP) and advanced flow cytometry, to study
children and young adults (<21 years) with mild, moderate or severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. GCFP allows the
use of disposable biosensor chips that can be mass-produced at low cost and spotted in microarray format to
greatly increase multiplexing capabilities. In addition, we will use a similar biomarker approach for rapid
differentiation of patients with MIS-C versus other pediatric infectious or inflammatory conditions where the
clinical presentation resembles MIS-C, most importantly Kawasaki disease. A child’s biologic and immunologic
response to SARS-CoV-2 exposure is likely influenced by a variety of factors, including genetics, epigenetics
and products of the mucosa/gut-brain axis, adipose tissue and neuroendocrine immune network, and further
modulated by environmental exposures. With these factors in mind, we hypothesize that a child’s biomarker
profile in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection enables a timely and accurate prediction of severity of Covid-19
and diagnosis of MIS-C, and will help guide treatment strategies, and predict patient outcomes. To test this
hypothesis, we will use a non-traditional diagnostic and comprehensive biomarker discovery to characterize the
clinical and laboratory spectrum of children and adolescents with mild, moderate and severe SARS-CoV-2
infection, as well as MIS-C. We will then validate our newly developed diagnostic and prognostic algorithm to
distinguish MIS-C from other inflammatory disorders with overlapping clinical manifestations, including Kawasaki

Abstract: The high aerosolized transmissibility of COVID, long asymptomatic incubation period,
and highly variable presentation attributes of the COVID pandemic have proven challenging in
many settings where patchwork pandemic responses have disproportionately negatively
impacted vulnerable socioeconomic, minority, and disabled sub-populations. Unfortunately, these
dire trends are only made more acute in settings that feature populations with limited mobility and
little to no ability to self-isolate (dense concentrated populations [DCPs]), such as residential
nursing homes, schools, drug rehabilitation services, prison and psychiatric facility populations,
and high-frequency essential medical services, such as chemotherapy infusion clinics or dialysis
units. In these DCP settings, limited diagnostic testing, prolonged indoor contact, limitations in
cleaning and filtration capacities, support staff shortages, pre-existing comorbidities, and lack of
effective infectious disease surveillance systems all collude to drive an increased COVID burden
in DCPs. From this, it is clear that alternative detection strategies for DCPs are urgently needed
to improve local capacity to monitor COVID outbreaks, mitigate their spread, and thus reduce
inequitable disease and mortality burdens in these under-resourced and often overcrowded
settings. In previous work, we developed a first generation detection system using heart rate data
from commercially-available Fitbit Ionic wearable devices to detect the onset of COVID and other
infectious diseases up to 10 days before users self-reported symptom onset (overall sensitivity
67% prior to symptom onset). Here, we propose to further develop this system for the improved
detection of COVID and other infectious diseases in DCPs using existing wearable fitness devices
in a wireless and interoperable digital health framework that centralizes all wearable-derived data
on PHD while tailoring its presentation and health event alert system to the IT capabilities and
needs of each DCP setting. In this, not only will we adapt our existing infection detection
algorithms for each DCP’s particular baseline characteristics, IT infrastructure, and needs, but
also use incoming data to further optimize the performance of those algorithms for continuous
improvement in the sensitivity, specificity, and alert lead time for COVID onset. This will quickly
enable under-resourced DCP support staff to access and use world-class COVID surveillance
data in identifying individual infection events, implementing isolation, cleaning, and testing
policies, and minimizing transmission, thus reducing the burden of COVID in DCP settings and
reducing DCP morbidity and mortality overall.","Multi-Modal Wireless COVID Monitoring & Infection Alerts for Concentrated Populations
Narrative: The myriad risks and health burdens accompanying the ongoing COVID pandemic
have disproportionately impacted under-resourced settings with dense, concentrated populations
that cannot readily transition to isolation or remote care. While diagnostic testing is increasingly
available, it remains inaccessible to too many and highlights an urgent unmet need for alternative
methods to detect COVID infection and spread. In previous work using online machine learning

onset up to 7 days in advance of symptoms, which we here propose to optimize and extend to

are membrane-enveloped positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses decorated with membrane proteins. The
spike (S) glycoprotein is implicated in the viral attachment and fusion to host cells via the human angiotensin-
converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). There are different assays to test for COVID-19, including nucleic acid, antigen,
and serological tests that can be used in hospitals, point-of-care, and large-scale population testing. Nucleic acid
testing is the standard method for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, which consists of the amplification of viral RNA
from nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).
Furthermore, given the invasive nature of NPS, saliva is being considered an alternative for detection. Methods
that bypass RNA extraction, as well as isothermal amplification such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification
(LAMP), have been developed to improve the speed of viral RNA detection. However, viral protein expression
cannot be detected by qRT-PCR. Serological tests, on the other hand, are based on host antibodies against the
virus (IgG/IgM). Although fast, these tests suffer from significant false negative/positive. Besides, they do not
detect a current infection. Therefore, to relieve the current healthcare crisis, new technologies capable of
simultaneous viral RNA/protein detection at the single virus level and host antibody response detection from a
body fluid in an integrated device would be highly valuable for enhanced COVID-19 diagnosis.
Recently, our group, as part of Phase 2 of the Extracellular RNA Communication Consortium (ERCC2), has
successfully developed a microfluidics technology capable of capturing individual exosomes from biofluids and
then simultaneously quantify both exosomal surface proteins and RNA cargo. Given the resemblance in size
and other characteristics between exosomes and coronaviruses, our technology can be adapted for COVID-19
diagnosis. Therefore, we propose to develop and validate a safe-to-use version of our microfluidics system for
direct detection of SARS-CoV-2. The integrated system is capable of multi-parametric detection for enhanced
COVID-19 diagnosis. The platform will be engineered to simultaneously quantify both viral protein, viral RNA,
and host antibodies (IgG/IgM) in the same sample, enabling diagnosis, disease status, and prognostic
assessment. Model systems, including host IgG/IgM from patient serum, standard synthetic vesicles (SVs), and
heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 viral particles (SVVs), will be designed and spiked in biofluids to validate and
calibrate the system. To demonstrate the clinical utility, our biochip technology will be deployed and tested using
different biofluids from COVID-19 patients at two independent laboratories (Institute of Systems Biology in
Seattle and The Ohio State University (OSU) Wexner Medical Center in Columbus). Measurements obtained
from the biochips will be compared to standard qRT-PCR and ELISA methods. A transition plan will be prepared
for FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) application of the biochip technology through a COVID-19 clinical
testing laboratory at OSU Wexner Medical Center. A commercialization plan will also be developed via licensing
to a biotech company.
We have assembled a multi-disciplinary team with extensive knowledge and experience in nanobiotechnology,
microfluidics, micro/nano-fabrication, infectious diseases, and clinical COVID-19 patient sample collection and
testing. The proposed aims and milestones are given as follows:
Specific Aim 1: Development of an integrated biochip to simultaneously capture, fix, and characterize
single SARS-CoV-2 and IgG/IgM proteins. Milestones. (i) Sorting, capture, and quantitative analysis of
selected proteins and viral RNA in single virus in spike experiments with >95% repeatability; (ii) A sensitivity of
single virus detection with >90% repeatability and 5-fold better sensitivity than the current qRT-PCR and ELISA
methods. Specific Aim 2: Testing of single SARS-CoV-2 virus and associated IgG/IgM in biofluids from
COVID-19 patients. Milestones. (i) Quantitative analysis of clinical samples with >95% repeatability; (ii) 95%
of concordance for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 between the biochip technology and the lab-based qRT-PCR
and ELISA. Specific Aim 3: Biochip technology transition plan. Milestones. (i) Submission of documentation
to the FDA Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) for EUA; (ii) Scale-up commercialization plan for
GMP chip production.","In this project, we propose to repurpose our single exosome-based characterization technology towards the
detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection from biofluids. Our
approach will enable the simultaneous detection of viral signals and host antibodies, including viral RNA, S-
protein, and associated IgG/IgM from the same sample on a single device, thus enabling enhanced diagnosis,
disease status, and prognostic assessment of COVID-19.",Other Research-Related,U18,RADx-rad,Exosome
U01AA029331,Nanobody-Based Electrochemical Biosensor for Real-Time Detection of Aerosolized SARS-CoV2,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has afflicted 6.2 million Americans and killed 190,000 as of early September
2020 (WHO website); a roughly 3% mortality. Between a shortage in testing and unidentified asymptomatic
individuals, the actual number of those infected could be 6 to 24-fold higher than that reported. SARS-CoV-2
(CoV-2), the virus underlying the disease, results in a range of symptoms; in select cases a severe respiratory
illness that impedes breathing that could lead to hospitalization and death. CoV-2 is transmitted person-to-
person via inhalation of the virus through mucosal membranes of the nose and throat from transfer after
touching a contaminated surface or by inhaling aerosolized virus. Unfortunately, COVID-19 is likely to be
prevalent well into 2021 and beyond.
 We must increase our ability to test for CoV-2. First, testing is needed to diagnose individuals that are
symptomatic or asymptomatic to reduce community spread. And second, monitoring gathering areas for
airborne virus that could inform the decision to shutdown a space or implement disinfection and mitigation of
an area. We propose to use an electrochemical biosensor in two detection devices, 1) a diagnostic
breathalyzer for instant detection of CoV-2 and 2) an airborne detector for real-time, continuous surveillance of
a large space.
 We have developed a novel ultra-sensitive, antibody-based electrochemical biosensor to detect CoV-2
repeat binding domain (RBD) spike protein. The technology is based on a micro-immunoelectrode (MIE)
biosensor pioneered by the Cirrito laboratory to study protein dynamics in the setting of neurodegeneration (2,3).
The biosensor uses voltammetry to measure the oxidation of tyrosine amino acids; oxidation is the release of
electrons that the biosensor measures as a change in current. Antibodies are covalently attached to the
electrode surface to provide selectivity. Our prototype CoV-2 biosensor is sensitive to 2 femtogram/ml,
compared to several current CoV-2 antigen tests that are sensitive to the low picogram/ml range.
 The proposal will first (Aim 1) optimize our CoV-2 biosensor to detect CoV-2 viral particles, as well as test
several parameters to increase sensitivity and longevity. Aim 2 will build a test breathalyzer that will utilize a
nebulizer to generate virus laden air containing aerosol droplets similar to a breath that contain defined
concentrations of CoV-2 viral particles. Aim 3 will test the airborne biosensor in a realistic environment. Co-I
Chakrabarty’s laboratory has unique capabilities of mimicking real-world environmental conditions, especially
in the context of atmospheric aerosols, necessary for testing and optimizing the biosensor’s performance for
field deployment. Atmospheric conditions include relative humidity (RH) and temperature, as well as common
airborne pollutants found indoors.
 Finding novel means to detect the CoV-2, as well as create a platform to detect other and future
pathogens, would enable us to limit the viral spread throughout the community in the current and future
pandemics.","COVID-19 has afflicted millions of Americans with a roughly 3% mortality rate. We have developed an
ultra-sensitive electrochemical biosensor to detect CoV-2 which we will incorporate into a breathalyzer for
diagnostic purposes, as well as an airborne detector to monitor large gathering spaces.",Non-SBIR/STTR,U01,RADx-rad,Automatic Detection & Tracing
U18TR003795,Portable GC detector for breath-based COVID diagnostics,"/Abstract: This proposal has two major goals: 1) Define signature exhaled breath volatile
organic compounds (VOCs) to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infections, and 2) Develop a portable chemical sensing
device that can capture and detect exhaled VOCs and includes machine learning algorithms for automated
data processing and results interpretation. This project will bring a portable sensor forward into clinical use with
the aim of supplementing COVID-19 diagnostics with a reagentless alternative. Breath testing of exhaled VOC
biomarkers is a relatively new concept that has the potential to transform healthcare in the US and globally.
Our overarching hypothesis is that a miniature breath analysis device can measure signatures of exhaled
breath VOCs in real-time and correlate their profile to viral upper respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV-2,
even asymptomatically. In Aim #1, we propose a prospective, observational study to analyze breath samples
from COVID-19 positive and negative subjects, solely for the purpose of analysis through gold standard GC-
MS to define breath VOC biomarkers of infection. We will recruit subjects at two local sites, the UC Davis
Medical Center (Sacramento, CA) and VA Northern California Health Care System (Mather, CA), where MPI
Dr. Kenyon and Co-Is Drs. Harper and Schivo have joint clinical appointments. Our group has a proven track
record to conduct these types of clinical breath studies. In Aim #2, we will develop a portable breath analysis
device using our novel miniature differential mobility spectrometry (DMS) detector, coupled with chip-based
gas chromatography. DMS is a subset of ion mobility spectrometry and detects VOCs at ambient temperatures
and pressures, making it highly appropriate for portable devices. This device would include our custom chip-
based preconcentrator, which is packed with a chemical sorbent for extraction of VOCs from breath, and will
compare functionality of a compact commercially available GC column to a micro-GC column chip from
Deviant, a subcontractor in this work. Individual components of this device have already been developed, and
under direction of MPI Prof. Davis, Chair of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, a team of research
engineers would integrate these pieces together into a single unit. Collaborator Prof. Chuah would guide
development of a custom software package for the device with machine learning and artificial intelligence
capabilities for automated data processing and interpretation. The device would be placed in the hands of
clinicians, who would provide feedback that engineers would immediately incorporate into the device and
return to the clinicians for more testing. Under Aim #3, our team would process the GC-MS and GC-DMS data
generated in this work, identifying a novel VOC profile for COVID-19 diagnostics. Aim #4 would initiate towards
the end of this study to develop both a regulatory pathway & contract manufacturing plan for large scale
production and deployment of the device for clinical approval. These efforts are supported by collaborator Dr.
Nam Tran, Director of Clinical Pathology & Clinical Chemistry at the UC Davis Medical Center.","In the United States and worldwide, public health experts agree that nations must increase
their capacity to test for COVID-19, yet global supplies for testing materials remain scarce. This project would
lead to the development of an entirely new type of COVID-19 test, one that could diagnose infections with only
a breath sample. Through this proposal, our team would develop a portable device that could identify people
with COVID-19 infections by analyzing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) found in exhaled breath.",Other Research-Related,U18,RADx-rad,SCENT
U01DC019573,Rapid olfactory tools for telemedicine-friendly COVID-19 screening and surveillance,"The COVID-19 pandemic is the most devastating infectious disease outbreak in a century, particularly in
underserved and minoritized communities. In 2020 alone, it will cost a million lives. It continues to wreak
economic havoc worldwide. Therefore, it is critical to develop new tools that can mitigate the spread of SARS-
CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Rapid screening tools can identify potentially infected individuals who
can then be isolated/quarantined from the uninfected and directed towards further testing and treatment.
Unfortunately, definitive viral testing for SARS-CoV-2 has proven difficult to implement in many countries,
including the US, due to technical, financial and governmental hurdles to universal access and timely
processing. Symptom-based screening offers a valuable, albeit imperfect, complement to viral testing that can
help identify many individuals with the disease for isolation as well as treatment. A major challenge with
symptomatic testing is that COVID-19 is highly protean: the heterogeneity of symptoms means no single
symptom or constellation of symptoms is definitive diagnostically. Still, there is growing evidence that sudden
partial or complete olfactory loss – even more than other symptoms such as fever or dry cough – is the single
best predictor of COVID-19. In this proposal, we will develop and implement objective, self-administered smell
tests for the purpose of identifying individuals with COVID-19 prior to, or in the absence of, viral testing, as well
as for use in population-level surveillance of COVID-19 spread. Several kinds of objective tests have been
used in clinical or laboratory settings to assess an individual's olfactory ability, including those that test the
ability to identify or discriminate odors as well as procedures to determine the lowest concentration an
individual can reliably perceive (i.e., odor detection threshold). Each approach has technical and logistical
advantages and disadvantages, and each captures different aspects of olfactory dysfunction. Regarding
COVID-19, it is unknown what type of measure has the highest specificity or sensitivity. In Aim 1, we will use
self-administered objective testing of odor identification and odor detection threshold in SARS-CoV-2-tested
individuals to determine which olfactory measure is the best predictor of COVID-19. In Aim 2, we will use
objective smell testing to assess whether population monitoring of olfactory loss in university, municipal or
other community settings can serve as a sentinel of COVID-19 community spread. Together, our studies will
provide a rapid, remote-friendly, cost-effective, scalable, non-intrusive method to screen for COVID-19 at the
individual level and to assess prevalence in communities, especially those that have been traditionally
underserved by the health care system and public health infrastructure.","Olfactory loss (anosmia or hyposmia) is the single best symptomatic predictor of COVID-19. Objective, self-
administered smell testing can accelerate identification of COVID-19 in individuals and communities –
particularly when timely viral testing is not readily available – and help mitigate community spread of this
dangerous disease.",Non-SBIR/STTR,U01,RADx-rad,Chemosensory Testing
U01DC019578,SCENTinel: A Rapid Smell Test for COVID-19 Surveillance,"Smell loss is a predominant symptom of COVID-19, and initial evidence based on self-reports suggests that
chemosensory loss is a sensitive predictor of COVID-19 in the general population, more so than fever.
However, given the natural lack of awareness of chemosensory changes, self-reports underestimate the true
prevalence of smell loss in patients with COVID-19 by 20% compared to an objective test. Therefore, we
propose testing and deploying a rapid and objective measure of smell ability, the SCENTinel test, inspired by
the NIH Toolbox® Odor Identification Test that our team previously developed. SCENTinel is an inexpensive,
and convenient smell test for COVID-19 surveillance of the population that quickly and easily assesses
three smell loss factors: odor detection, odor intensity, and odor identification. It is designed for practical use in
several contexts, including high-density areas such as community medical sites, universities, subacute care
facilities, and both industrial and nonindustrial workplaces. Our multi-disciplinary team has expertise in
understanding taste and smell, developing and validating chemosensory tests, as well as studying the broad
symptomatology of COVID-19. The group is led by MPI Dalton from the Monell Chemical Senses Center, an
expert in human olfaction and designing olfactory tests; MPI Parma from Temple University is an expert in
COVID-19 smell loss, is the Chair of the Global Consortium for Chemosensory Research, and has expertise in
conducting research in rapidly changing situations; Dr. Schalet and his team at Northwestern University and
Dr. Chun and his team at Yale University, among the other established and interested partners (Fox subacute
nursing homes, Hormel Food). Our team also includes the Director of Technology Transfer at the Monell
Center, Dr. O’Leary, to explore potential partners and expand SCENTinel deployment nationwide. Dr. Reed
from the Monell Chemical Senses Center will work directly with the Data Coordination Center, drawing on her
experience in managing large shared NIH datasets. All will work closely with the NIH Project Scientist. This
proposal aims to a) fine-tune SCENTinel’s ability to predict a positive COVID-19 diagnostic test; b) examine
marginal smell loss as a sign of the earliest phases of COVID-19, before a positive diagnostic test; and c)
assess the test’s psychometric validity with test-retest reliability measures and validation against the NIH
Toolbox® Odor Identification Test. Together, these aims will establish a standardized protocol for use of
SCENTinel as a rapid and objective smell test that can easily be incorporated into onsite COVID-19 testing
centers, schools, and workplaces nationwide. Furthermore, it will provide key insights into early-onset
chemosensory symptoms in relation to a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, providing a crucially needed means
to contain the spread of COVID-19.","As COVID-19 continues to spread in concurrence with the reopening of activities and workplaces, there is an
immediate need to develop more robust screening tools to ensure everyone’s personal safety. Loss of the
sense of smell is an early and sensitive predictor of COVID-19 infection. The goal of this project is to develop
the SCENTinel test, an inexpensive, rapid, and highly scalable objective smell test to use for COVID-19

U01DA053941,Development and Proof-of-Concept Implementation of the South Florida Miami RADx-rad SARS-CoV-2 Wastewater-Based Surveillance Infrastructure,"The University of Miami (UM), with three primary campuses in Miami, Florida, is geographically spread within
one of the worst current COVID-19 hotbeds. UM has deployed an elaborate human surveillance testing, tracking
and tracing (3T) system to monitor the student body, faculty, and staff. This 3T system includes a major hospital
that is part of UM and that treats COVID-19 patients. To augment this COVID-19 monitoring system, UM has
deployed a pilot wastewater surveillance program for detecting SARS-CoV-2 from clusters of buildings on
campus. Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM) is located in New York City, NY, an area that until recently had one of
the worst outbreaks of COVID-19. WCM has established an international consortium for SARS-CoV-2
environmental surveillance, including in NYC and globally with the MetaSUB Consortium, which is creating
metagenomic and metatranscriptomic maps of the world’s sewage. Based on this work at both UM and WCM,
this proposal aims to develop, implement, and demonstrate effective and predictive wastewater surveillance by
optimizing sampling, concentration, and detection strategies. Working closely with the RADx-rad Data
Coordination Center (DCC), this application (SF-RAD) will develop and implement data standards and
informatics infrastructure and perform integrative analyses to make all data, results, and models available to the
community, thus providing a critical contribution to the national SARS-COV-2 RADx-rad Wastewater Detection
Consortium. Our objectives will be addressed through three aims. Aim 1: Data Standardization, focuses on
developing and implementing data standards and quality metrics, and establishing the operational infrastructure
to manage SARS-CoV-2 wastewater-based surveillance datasets and metadata. Aim 2: Wastewater
Characterization, focuses on optimizing wastewater surveillance protocols and parameters for wastewater
sampling, sample concentration, and viral detection technologies. Aim 3: Integration with Human Health
Surveillance, focuses on metatranscriptomic analyses and on the integration of wastewater quantification data
with community and hospital COVID-19 prevalence, to develop predictive models to detect local and community
level spread of COVID-19. All data will be made Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) in
close collaboration with the DCC, and will be collected and managed with attention to ethical issues in
surveillance and data management, including efforts to ensure research rigor and reproducibility. The results
from this proposal will develop and deploy experimental and informatics infrastructure and operations as part of
the national RADx-rad SARS-CoV-2 wastewater surveillance network and will provide a proof-of-concept
implementation to use wastewater for infectious disease surveillance for early detection of localized COVID-19

processing, detection, and analysis approaches. We hypothesize that sensitivity (enhanced detection and
recovery) can be improved by optimizing sampling and concentration strategies, and that specificity (viral strain
identification for epidemiologic tracking) can be improved by optimizing wastewater detection methods. The
results from this proposal will develop and deploy experimental and informatics infrastructure and operations,

R61HD105610,Severity Predictors Integrating salivary Transcriptomics and proteomics with Multi neural network Intelligence in SARS-CoV2 infection in Children (SPITS MISC),"Children have been disproportionately less impacted by the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused
by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SAR-CoV-2) compared to adults. However,
severe illnesses including Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C) and respiratory failure have occurred
in a small proportion of children with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nearly 80% of children with MIS-C are critically ill
with a 2-4% mortality rate. Currently there are no modalities to characterize the spectrum of disease severity
and predict which child with SARS-CoV-2 exposure will likely develop severe illness including MIS-C. Thus
there is an urgent need to develop a diagnostic modality to distinguish the varying phenotypes of disease and
risk stratify disease. The epigenetic changes in microRNA (miRNA) profiles that occur due to an infection can
impact disease severity by altering immune response and cytokine regulation which may be detected in body
fluids including saliva. Our long-term goal is to improve outcomes of children with SARS-CoV-2 by early
identification and treatment of those at risk for severe illness. Our central hypothesis is that a model that
integrates salivary biomarkers with social and clinical determinants of health will predict disease severity in
children with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The central hypothesis will be pursued through phased four specific aims.
The first two aims will be pursued during the R61 phase and include: 1) Define and compare the salivary
molecular host response in children with varying phenotypes (severe and non severe) SARS-CoV-2 infections
and 2) Develop and validate a sensitive and specific model to predict severe SARS-CoV-2 illness in children.
During the R33 phase we will pursue the following two aims: 3) Develop a portable, rapid device that quantifies
salivary miRNAs with comparable accuracy to predicate technology (qRT-PCR), and 4) Develop an artificial
intelligence (AI) assisted cloud and mobile system for early recognition of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in
children. We will pursue the above aims using an innovative combination of salivaomics and bioinformatics,
analytic techniques of AI and clinical informatics. The proposed research is significant because development of
a sensitive model to risk stratify disease is expected to improve outcomes of children with severe SARS-CoV-2
infection via early recognition and timely intervention. The proximate expected outcome of this proposal is
better understanding of the epigenetic regulation of host immune response to the viral infection which we
expect to lead to personalized therapy in the future. The results will have a positive impact immediately as it
will lead to the creation of patient profiles based on individual risk factors which can enable early identification
of severe disease and appropriate resource allocation during the pandemic.","This project is relevant to public health as development of a predictive model that integrates salivary

U01AA029316,"Touchscreen-compatible, real-time electrochemical sensing of SARS-CoV-2","The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, the cause of the COVID-19 global pandemic, is efficiently spread
and has reached over 27 million confirmed cases as of September 8, 2020. There is therefore an
urgent need for new technologies that can provide early detection of virus, reducing the
transmission and infection rate. The goal of this proposal is to develop an integrated biosensor-
touchscreen that sensitivity reports surface contact with SARS-CoV-2. In our preliminary work,
we have identified several aptamers that bind specifically to the envelope-anchored trimeric spike
(S) protein of SARS-CoV-2, but not of SARS-CoV or MERS. In comparison to antibodies,
aptamers are synthetic molecules that more thermally stable and lower cost while providing
similar specificity and affinity of target binding. In this application, we propose to integrate
aptamer-based biosensing of SARS-CoV-2 into a touchscreen device. Our main objectives are to
1) engineer conformation switching aptamers for electrochemical sensing of SARS-CoV-2
binding, 2) develop nanogap capacitive sensors as a uniquely complementary approach to
capacitive touchscreen technology and 3) build and test an integrated biosensor and touchscreen
array that can detect SARS-CoV-2 from patient samples. Successful completion of these aims
will result in a novel automatic sensing platform for SARS-CoV-2. This technology could transform
personal device touchscreens as well as to multi-user touchscreen devices in hospitals, airports,

R01DE031114,Validation of Smart Masks for Surveillance of COVID-19,"Vulnerable populations do not just need testing—they need surveillance. The ideal surveillance tool would
operate in the background with minimal involvement of the population to be tested; it would be simple,
affordable, reliable, and accurate. Unfortunately, no such surveillance system yet exists. Here, we propose
a “smart mask” that changes colors when the wearer has been exposed to biomarkers (proteases) of
COVID-19. These proteases are known to be in saliva, and the smart mask will concentrate the proteases
from aerosolized saliva when the subject breathes and speaks through the smart mask. This is a simple
yet novel approach to surveillance because most people are already wearing masks—especially in high-
risk settings. Our first goal is to optimize the reagents that will monitor the proteases. We will customize
the peptide sequences such that the reagents change color only when two key SARS proteases are
present. After characterizing the colorimetric reagents, Aim 2 will integrate these reagents into an adhesive
strip (i.e., a sticker) that can be affixed to any existing cloth or surgical mask. Aim 3 is validation with human
subjects. First, we will use biobanked saliva samples that are confirmed to be either COVID-19-positive or
COVID-19-negative. Next, we will evaluate how long people infected with SARS-CoV-2 must breathe
through the smart mask before it changes colors. Finally, we will use the smart mask for surveillance of a
population that is concurrently being tested regularly via PCR. We will calculate the sensitivity and
specificity of the smart masks through comparison to PCR. We will measure true positives, true negatives,
false positives, and false negatives and estimate needing 800 subjects, which is very feasible at our
institution. Our team is well-suited to conduct this research because of Dr. Jokerst’s training colorimetric
sensing; Drs. Penny, Knight, and Laurent have decades of human subjects research experience, and Dr.
Tu offers biostatistical experience to confirm study design. This work could have a significant impact on
the pandemic because our proposed design combines the simplicity of the home pregnancy test with the
specificity of expensive viral-based assays. It is practical because it uses the masks that are already
common in daily life and reports the presence of SARS viruses via a simple color change. While a vaccine
will hopefully be deployed during the course of this work, the proteases evaluated here have been
implicated in a variety of SARS viruses. Thus, this work will be useful should future pandemics emerge.","We propose to build a mask that changes color when the wearer has COVID-19 or has been
exposed to COVID-19. Mask-wearing is currently widespread and thus adding this colorimetric

coronavirus morbidity and mortality. This was true for Tribal nations, whose sovereign status enabled swift and
preventative measures such as lock-downs and border closures, yet whose culture contributed to additional
unique risk factors. Among those are testing disparities, underlying health factors, and community infrastructure.
However, clinical testing doesn’t capture the extent of positive cases, and without the collective efforts of this
project, Tribes will likely not be included in wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) analysis, which has garnered
wide-spread interest due to its ability to generate data in advance of community infectivity. In this project, we will
show that WBE is a non-invasive, culturally appropriate biomonitoring strategy that can be adopted and
implemented by Tribal communities to empower them with a practical, yet technologically advanced health
surveillance tool. Building upon a rigorous methodology of Tribal consultation and community-based participatory
research, assessment of wastewater and community infrastructure, and training of Tribal wastewater operators
and health administrators on WBE, we will form the WBE Tribal Coordination Center. Tribes will be recruited
through the InterTribal Council of Arizona’s National Tribal Water and Wastewater Operator Training Program
network. We will measure coronavirus in wastewater across U.S. reservations using established RT-qPCR
techniques and a novel protein quantification method, and we will sequence viral RNA extracts to assess SARS-
CoV-2 variants in Tribal communities. Risk factors contributing to elevated COVID-19 in Tribal communities will
be quantified with integration of geospatial analysis. Frameworks for risks from numerous environmentally-
transmitted pathogens have been developed by our team, setting a foundation to incorporate variability and
uncertainty for Tribal settings with qualitative information from Tribes in order to appropriately scope our modeling
efforts. Simulation results will help to target resources efficiently for monitoring and public health interventions
by identifying specific sampling locations where it is most likely to detect SARS-CoV-2 given other community
and scientific constraints. Information from the RADx Data Coordination Center will be used to the fullest extent
to compare Tribal communities with their non-Tribal counterparts. Through the coronavirus pandemic and
beyond, Tribes will be better informed of their ability to use WBE to measure community health, thereby
protecting community health and building capacity for future applications and research translation.","SARS-CoV-2 wastewater-based epidemiology is particularly applicable for Tribal communities who wish to
improve testing rates, are managing operational plans, or want to observe temporal trends within a defined

U01DA053903,Wastewater Assessment for Coronavirus in Kentucky: Implementing Enhanced Surveillance Technology,"Wastewater Assessment for Coronavirus in Kentucky – Implementing Enhanced Surveillance
Technology
Surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 is hindered by the availability of testing, particularly in remote and rural
areas. Screening of wastewater for SARS-CoV-2 viral biomarkers offers a viable alternative to individual
testing and it can identify communities and facilities that are at risk of becoming hotspots.Wastewater
surveillance overcomes several limitations of clinical surveillance, such as the need for robust healthcare
and laboratory infrastructure and the lack of representative and comprehensive testing within
communities. Conventional wastewater surveillance takes samples from sewer systems or wastewater
treatment facilities and uses a series of extraction steps prior to advanced PCR technology to quantitate
the viral biomarker (RNA). This approach is time and resource-intensive, which limits its wide-scale
application. Developing next generation technology to simplify wastewater RNA extraction and
quantitation will make it feasible to use more broadly at facilities and in rural communities. The limited
clinical testing for COVID-19 in rural Southeastern Kentucky hampers disease surveillance and prevents
informed public action to mitigate and contain the spread of disease. Wastewater testing for SARS-CoV-
2 in these communities using field-friendly technology will provide important information to local
authorities and citizens about the spread and trend of SARS-CoV-2 infection in their communities. Our
project will accomplish two aims: 1) Develop next generation wastewater assessment technology and 2)
Implement and evaluate the next generation wastewater assay. For Aim 1 we adapt technology invented
by our team termed exclusion-based sample preparation (ESP) to simplify and improve RNA extraction
from wastewater. We will pair ESP with loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) technology for
RNA detection to create a sensitive, robust, and field-friendly platform for testing wastewater for SARS-
CoV-2 RNA. We will compare the next generation assay with established techniques on metrics of
sensitivity, specificity, and usability (e.g., assay time, number of assay steps). For Aim 2 we will first
validate the next generation assay in the field at congregate living facilities in a side-by-side comparison
with conventional wastewater surveillance. Next, building on existing relationships in Appalachian
Kentucky, we will recruit and train a purposive group of wastewater treatment plant operators, watershed
watch citizen scientists, and school science teachers to test wastewater in their communities and schools
using the field-friendly next generation wastewater assay. Field results will be validated in the lab. A
robust mixed methods evaluation using the RE-AIM framework will assess community perceptions of
feasibility, acceptability, and utility of wastewater surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 and identify community
measures taken in response to test results.","The goal of this project is to develop a “next generation” assay for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 in

quantify the amount of coronavirus RNA in a wastewater sample, such that additional precautions (e.g.
individual testing, infection prevention measures) can be taken when needed.",Non-SBIR/STTR,U01,RADx-rad,Wastewater
U01DA053893,Wastewater Detection of COVID-19,"When faced with a pandemic such as SARS-Coronavirus-2 (SAR-CoV-2), the virus responsible for COVID-19,
timely risk assessment and action are required to prevent public health impacts to entire communities.
Because infected individuals may not have access to testing or may be asymptomatic and contraction can
mean death, a proactive approach to detect the virus is needed to develop public health strategy to mitigate
virus spread. Recent studies have detected SAR-CoV-2 genetic material in sewage and demonstrate a
positive correlation between the concentration of viral markers and reported cases1-5. The Coronavirus
Sewershed Surveillance Project (CSSP) is a collaborative effort to monitor sewersheds for genetic indicators of
COVID-19 in wastewater to provide additional, population-level information about virus circulation that is not
captured by clinical testing. Untreated wastewater (influent) samples are screened weekly from select
sewersheds and targeted micro-sewersheds for detection and “true” prevalence. Congregate facilities provide
unique opportunities for study because they are controlled populations where the precise number and timing of
infections can be defined. Our team will utilize detailed monitoring of congregate facilities to define the precise
per patient contribution and longevity of SARS-COV-2 RNA to wastewater by 1) increasing the number of
facilities tested, 2) altering the frequency at which samples are collected, and 3) comparing sewershed data
collected to clinical patient case data.
Although SARS-COV-2 contribution/patient varies among communities, there have been clear outlier
communities that produce little or no genetic material in the wastewater despite the presence of known
outbreaks. The reason for this lost signal is not known, so our team will define factors that contribute to SARS-
COV-2 signal suppression in wastewater by 1) defining the physical nature of the genetic material in the
sewershed to better understand the types of factors that could suppress signal, 2) expanding testing within
sewersheds with suppressed signal as well as from additional facilities with similar population and industry
demographics as those with suppressed signal to narrow the sources of signal suppression, 3) performing
exhaustive chemical characterization comparing wastewater from locations that are suppressed to those that
are not to identify candidate compounds that could be causing suppression, and 4) obtaining or generating
candidate inhibitors and test their ability to suppress signal from viral genetic material in a controlled
experimental setting.","Testing of wastewater for genetic traces of SARS-COV-2, a novel Coronavirus that has
caused a destructive worldwide pandemic, has been shown to be an effective method
for gaining population-level data about viral prevalence and infectivity trends. However,
because we lack critical knowledge about the factors that contribute to SARS-COV-2
detection in wastewater, these measurements currently cannot be used to accurately
predict how many infected patients exist in a population. With a better understanding of
the individual patient contribution and duration of SARS-COV-2 signal in wastewater as
well as a better understanding of factors that affect signal detection, it will be possible to
more accurately predict the severity of outbreaks in populations using this powerful
technique.",Non-SBIR/STTR,U01,RADx-rad,Wastewater
