MIS-C compromised several organs (e.g. heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, or gastrointestinal tract), and it can be deadly. Indeed, in a sizable proportion of cases (up to 40%), the patient requires to be admitted to the ICU service. Therefore, it is critical to understand who is at risk (e.g. those with allergic or non-allergic diseases) those with alterations in the IgE network (platelets, eosinophils, specific Th2 or Th17 cytokines). Our long term objective is to develop new strategies for early diagnosis and to identify biomarkers of risk that can be easily deployed globally.
