       "      <td>This project addresses the following question: how do we better understand the genetic basis of health and disease, considering similarities between related diseases, different types of data, complex patterns of genetic variation, across a diverse range of individuals with different genetic and sociodemographic backgrounds? We develop statistical methods to identify disease-related patterns in genomic data that can help us understand shared biological mechanisms underlying related diseases. In addition, we develop methods that can combine insights from different data sources (e.g., biobanks or health systems) without any merging of data and while ensuring the privacy of the datasets to comply with relevant data sharing policies. These tools can help us derive insights from a larger pool of individuals, which is especially helpful for studies of rare diseases or underrepresented populations. We expect this project to result in an improved understanding of genetic factors underlying human health that can improve health-related decision making in diverse populations.</td>\n",
       "      <td>The growing collection of genomic datasets are empowering researchers to discover new links between genotypes and a diverse range of health conditions. Although biobanking efforts such as the UK Biobank, the All of Us Research Program, and the Million Veterans Program have resulted in large-scale repositories including a variety of biomedical and social information about the study participants, we currently lack the analysis methods and tools needed to effectively tease apart complex genetic associations in diverse human populations, including those with rare health conditions and those from underrepresented or admixed ancestry backgrounds. To this end, we aim to develop novel statistical methods and algorithmic tools to identify disease-related patterns or biomarkers in genomic datasets to improve our understanding of shared biological mechanisms underlying different diseases. The overarching goal of this research is to overcome the challenges introduced by limited sample sizes in genetic studies by making more effective use of the available information and combining information across different contexts. As part of this work, we will develop tools that can integrate insights from different diseases, ancestry groups, data modalities, and research sites or organizations (e.g., biobanks or health systems). We aim to combine signals across different entities without any merging of data through the use of modern privacy-enhancing technologies, which ensure the privacy of the datasets to comply with relevant data sharing policies. The insights resulting from this work will enable more accurate and efficient approaches to support clinical decisions regarding diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment choices in a manner that is tailored to individual patients factoring in their genetic and social backgrounds. To support this research endeavor, we have identified and included in this application a diverse set of genomic studies in dbGaP that span different diseases and race/ethnicities represented by the study participants. We will be analyzing these datasets specifically in the contexts of association tests, fine-mapping, disease risk prediction, patient stratification, and related analyses to derive novel biomedical insights into the diseases associated with the individual datasets. Another aspect of the project aims to better understand ethical use of data with respect to privacy and equity in order to encourage collaborative research and broader data sharing. Building upon these insights, we will investigate how shared patterns of biological data across different cohorts and studies can be leveraged to improve the discovery of valuable biomedical insights.   In compliance with the PUB consent code, we will publish and otherwise broadly share any findings, computational techniques, and software tools developed in this project with the scientific community.</td>\n",

       "4  This project addresses the following question: how do we better understand the genetic basis of health and disease, considering similarities between related diseases, different types of data, complex patterns of genetic variation, across a diverse range of individuals with different genetic and sociodemographic backgrounds? We develop statistical methods to identify disease-related patterns in genomic data that can help us understand shared biological mechanisms underlying related diseases. In addition, we develop methods that can combine insights from different data sources (e.g., biobanks or health systems) without any merging of data and while ensuring the privacy of the datasets to comply with relevant data sharing policies. These tools can help us derive insights from a larger pool of individuals, which is especially helpful for studies of rare diseases or underrepresented populations. We expect this project to result in an improved understanding of genetic factors underlying human health that can improve health-related decision making in diverse populations.   \n",

DCC facilitates âdata standardization, harmonization, integration, and analysis across RADx-rad projects and coordinates quality control, data curation, and analyses, and provides tools to monitor progress, performance, and use of the curated dataâ (RFA-OD-20-019). To fulfill these requirements, we will perform the following evaluations: 1. Measure the extent of shared data elements across (i) projects within the same or related FOA areas, (ii), projects across all RADx-rad. 2. Evaluate the quality and consistency of data submissions. 3. Compare the performance of diagnostic methods for analytical and clinical performance. 4. Correlate analytical with clinical performance. 5. Develop data analysis templates and use cases to demonstrate data integration across RADx-rad projects. 6. Evaluate the ease of use and capabilities of the NIH Data Hub to (i) access datasets, (ii) data dictionaries, (iii) develop and run data analyses (for # 1. â 5.) in the Data Hub workbench.

       "4  The growing collection of genomic datasets are empowering researchers to discover new links between genotypes and a diverse range of health conditions. Although biobanking efforts such as the UK Biobank, the All of Us Research Program, and the Million Veterans Program have resulted in large-scale repositories including a variety of biomedical and social information about the study participants, we currently lack the analysis methods and tools needed to effectively tease apart complex genetic associations in diverse human populations, including those with rare health conditions and those from underrepresented or admixed ancestry backgrounds. To this end, we aim to develop novel statistical methods and algorithmic tools to identify disease-related patterns or biomarkers in genomic datasets to improve our understanding of shared biological mechanisms underlying different diseases. The overarching goal of this research is to overcome the challenges introduced by limited sample sizes in genetic studies by making more effective use of the available information and combining information across different contexts. As part of this work, we will develop tools that can integrate insights from different diseases, ancestry groups, data modalities, and research sites or organizations (e.g., biobanks or health systems). We aim to combine signals across different entities without any merging of data through the use of modern privacy-enhancing technologies, which ensure the privacy of the datasets to comply with relevant data sharing policies. The insights resulting from this work will enable more accurate and efficient approaches to support clinical decisions regarding diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment choices in a manner that is tailored to individual patients factoring in their genetic and social backgrounds. To support this research endeavor, we have identified and included in this application a diverse set of genomic studies in dbGaP that span different diseases and race/ethnicities represented by the study participants. We will be analyzing these datasets specifically in the contexts of association tests, fine-mapping, disease risk prediction, patient stratification, and related analyses to derive novel biomedical insights into the diseases associated with the individual datasets. Another aspect of the project aims to better understand ethical use of data with respect to privacy and equity in order to encourage collaborative research and broader data sharing. Building upon these insights, we will investigate how shared patterns of biological data across different cohorts and studies can be leveraged to improve the discovery of valuable biomedical insights.   In compliance with the PUB consent code, we will publish and otherwise broadly share any findings, computational techniques, and software tools developed in this project with the scientific community.   \n",
