MIS-C compromised several organs (e.g. heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, or gastrointestinal tract), and it can be deadly. Indeed, in a sizable proportion of cases (up to 40%), the patient requires to be admitted to the ICU service. Therefore, it is critical to understand who is at risk (e.g. those with allergic or non-allergic diseases) those with alterations in the IgE network (platelets, eosinophils, specific Th2 or Th17 cytokines).

       "0  This request supports the RADx-rad program outcomes evaluation by the RADx-rad Discoveries and Research Center (DCC). DCC facilitates âdata standardization, harmonization, integration, and analysis across RADx-rad projects and coordinates quality control, data curation, and analyses, and provides tools to monitor progress, performance, and use of the curated dataâ (RFA-OD-20-019). To fulfill these requirements, we will perform the following evaluations: 1. Measure the extent of shared data elements across (i) projects within the same or related FOA areas, (ii), projects across all RADx-rad. 2. Evaluate the quality and consistency of data submissions. 3. Compare the performance of diagnostic methods for analytical and clinical performance. 4. Correlate analytical with clinical performance. 5. Develop data analysis templates and use cases to demonstrate data integration across RADx-rad projects. 6. Evaluate the ease of use and capabilities of the NIH Data Hub to (i) access datasets, (ii) data dictionaries, (iii) develop and run data analyses (for # 1. â 5.) in the Data Hub workbench.  Another aim of the project will be developing and applying tools to enable collaborative learning of heterogeneous data across multiple data collection sites. We will explore a combination of federated learning and secure computation strategies to train novel machine learning models that can effectively extract insights from distributed datasets in an interpretable manner.   \n",

MIS-C compromised several organs (e.g. heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, or gastrointestinal tract), and it can be deadly. Indeed, in a sizable proportion of cases (up to 40%), the patient requires to be admitted to the ICU service. Therefore, it is critical to understand who is at risk (e.g. those with allergic or non-allergic diseases) those with alterations in the IgE network (platelets, eosinophils, specific Th2 or Th17 cytokines). Our long term objective is to develop new strategies for early diagnosis and to identify biomarkers of risk that can be easily deployed globally.   Based on our strong preliminary data, we want to validate our findings in a pediatric cohort. The RADx hub will provide a unique opportunity to do so with the large data available. This team is uniquely qualified to do such analyses given the medical background of the PI, our ongoing work in COVID both in humans and with animal models, our unique expertise in IgE, and expertise using machine learning and model-based analyses.      \n",
